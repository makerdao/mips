## Sentence Summary

This subproposal offboards Amy Jung from Operational Support.

## Specification

### Motivation

I, Amy Jung, the Facilitator of Operational Support, am offboarding effective May 31, 2021 on entirely good terms.

Operational Support was mandated as a domain using the former structure of MIP23. Operational Support will no longer exist as a domain nor a team in the MIP39: Core Unit Framework. Most of the mandate of this team has merged with [Sustainable Ecosystem Scaling Core Unit: SES-001](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/operational-support-weekly-update-april-5-8-2021/7381).

This subproposal is largely a formality to confirm the decision and officially remove the authority and permissions I continue to hold as an Operational Support Facilitator.

### Core Unit ID

- Operational Support was [mandated as a domain](https://vote.makerdao.com/executive/5fbb7ab169fd97001ae7442b?network=mainnet#proposal-detail) using the former MIP23 structure and as mentioned, it is not being proposed as Core Unit. There is no Core Unit ID.
