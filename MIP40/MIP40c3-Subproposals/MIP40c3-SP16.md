### Quarterly Focus

I am proposing a variable budget that gives us the freedom and flexibility to grow operations as needed.

### Team Membership

The Strategic Happiness Core Unit team will include:

- **@Saint.Burban:** Random-Time, Shitpost Facilitator, Chief Happiness Officer

### Quarterly Budget

#### Team Remuneration

The Strategic Happiness team should be incentivized toward behaviors that support raising the morale of the MakerDAO Community. In addition to base pay, each SHCU member will operate under a strict compensation structure, a proactive process that aligns incentives with those of MakerDAO.

The compensation structure follows these rules:

- Base pay will be 0 DAI.
- Two-quarters of goal achievement constitutes a 0% raise in base pay.
- Not meeting goals results in base pay stagnation.
- Bonus pay is determined by MakerDAO Governance.

#### MKR Vesting

The Strategic Happiness Core Unit proposes to vest its members with MKR to further align incentives.

The MKR will be vested over a four-year vesting period, with a one-year cliff, subject to review based on performance.

Vesting is proposed as follows:

- **@Saint.Burban:** 1 MKR

The total amount to be vested is to be determined by MakerDAO Governance.

***Note:** Vesting, of course, is optional… but wouldn’t it be nice? :)*
