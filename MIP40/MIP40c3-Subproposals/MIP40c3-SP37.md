## Sentence Summary

MIP40c3-SP37 adds the budget for Core Unit GRO-001: Growth for November 2021 through June 2022.

## Paragraph Summary

This budget proposal covers a total of 8 months (November and December 2021 and H1 2022) to cover the remaining months until the end of the year and the first six months of 2022.

Growth CU is requesting an eight months budget allocation of 2,208,484 DAI. 1,117,663 DAI will cover operations, and 1,100,000 DAI will cover the work we’ll do with our partners in the latest stages of the Growth Cycle (adoption campaigns, educational content, etc.). The remaining budget from the previous months (posted in our weekly updates at the beginning of each month) is deducted from the total of the current budget.

### Motivation

We are proposing this Core Unit Budget modification because Growth CU requires an operating budget to fulfill its mandate.

### Core Unit Name

Growth (GRO-001)

### Q4-21 Focus (November and December)

* Progression of our pipeline. The general outline of our traditional cycle consists of the following phases: Outreach → Initial conversations → Project formalization and commitment → Integrations support → Pre-launch growth → The partner Launch → Maintenance and growth. We want to focus on the 97 opportunities in the latest stages of the Growth Process cycle during this quarter (pre-launch, partner launch, and maintenance) which requires the “integrations and marketing” budget to execute the growth plans we created with our partners.

* As we have posted in previous weekly updates, there’s an interest from various companies to interact with the Maker Protocol but in a permission way (due to their compliance team, to operate with us, they need a company to KYC). We are exploring alternatives with our legal advisors and these companies’ compliance team to develop a product for these institutions (traditional institutions).

### H1-22 Focus (January-June)

* We have 612 leads to qualified and try to move them as opportunities into our pipeline, plus the progression of our open pipeline for H1. (During the beginning of each quarter, we will post the status of our pipeline).

* Institutional vaults. We will be onboarding new institutions (crypto-institutions) into the Institutional Vaults product to increase the number of crypto-vaults with more than 200m DAI.
* Multichain strategy. We will continue to include Dai in other chains and increase its utilization through new projects on those chains integrating and incentivizing Dai usage. Also, we will follow the protocol progress in terms of bridges and deployment in other chains to support its adoption and growth.
* PSM and other collaterals. We will work with other projects/companies to develop partnerships when onboarding their token as collateral. The idea of these partnerships is to guarantee a long-term relationship and an agreement that benefits both parties.
* Grants program. We want to promote the development of the Ecosystem, supporting and funding projects committed to innovating using the Maker Protocol as a medium. We want to motivate them to run projects that build technology or resources on the Maker Protocol. To support this initiative, we will be running an ongoing grants program and also partnering with ETHGlobal Hackathons.
* Message Propagation. During the following months, we will look for different ways to propagate Maker’s voice through developing partnerships that will help us communicate Maker’s message.

#### Contributors costs

The Business Development contributors should feel persuaded toward behaviors that will support the Maker Protocol strategy. That’s why besides a base pay, each one of our BD persons will be under a compensation structure, a proactive process that forms goals around the account planning process and accounts for past performance/growth.

The compensation structure follows these rules:

1. Two-quarters of goal achievement constitutes a 10% rise in their base Dai contribution.
2. Not meeting goals results in base pay stagnation.
3. Less than 50% of goal number achieved results in 0 bonus for the quarter.
4. Bonus pay is determined as a percentage of base pay, and it’s relative to the goal number’s achievement.
5. Bonus is capped at 100% of base pay.

#### Finance costs.

To cover associated costs to legal advice and the enablement of all support applications.

Direct operations costs.

This item includes travel costs (for conferences and one offsite) and any software or tool needed to execute our job.

#### Buffer

To support any contingency or opportunity that could appear, like a tier-one partner looking to execute a strategic action.

#### Integrations and Marketing

When we are working with future partners, part of our job is to create a way to help that partner give more visibility to the new solution supported by the Maker Protocol. Sometimes the execution of that idea requires a budget for different purposes:

* Educational purposes: When a partner wants to explain to their user/customer base about the new product, usually this is for creating content in a particular language oriented to a defined audience.

* Marketing purposes: Budget for executing a marketing campaign to help our partner to expose the usage of the new solution.
* Technical purposes: Some partners that are not part of the crypto ecosystem need specialized help to integrate the Maker protocol with their systems.

### Budget Implementation

Growth CU has a multi-signature wallet to administer the funds allocated to fulfilling the mandate. The details of this multi-sig wallet are as follows:

**Multi-sig Address:** 0x7800C137A645c07132886539217ce192b9F0528e

As we have fixed monthly expenses (contributor costs and the buffer) and variable quarterly expenses (Finance costs, Direct operations costs and Integrations and Marketing costs) we propose two parallel budget implementations, the streamed payment for the fixed monthly expenses and the manual implementation for the variable quarterly expenses:

* **942,663 DAI** will be streamed to 0x7800C137A645c07132886539217ce192b9F0528e starting 2021-11-01 and ending 2022-06-30 at a rate of 117,833 DAI per month.

For the total Variable expenses for eight months = 1,265,821 DAI, the budget implementation is manual and paid at the beginning of each quarter. Because our quarterly schedule is misaligned, the first payment should be included in the first executive of November and the second payment should be included in the first executive of April (In the event of the first executive of the month failing to pass successfully, transfers should be included in the next available executive vote), for each executive these are the payments to be done:

* **791,138 DAI** will be transferred to 0x7800C137A645c07132886539217ce192b9F0528e on 2021-11-10
* **474,683 DAI** will be transferred to 0x7800C137A645c07132886539217ce192b9F0528e on 2022-04-06
