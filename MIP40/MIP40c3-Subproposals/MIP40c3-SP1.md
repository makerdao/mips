* The budget is based on [the proposition made on the forum](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/team-funding-experiment-rwa-objectives-and-cost-structure/5954).
* This budget implementation uses the Manual Budget Implementations, the Simple one, or any other method achieving the same result at the discretion of the Governance Facilitators.
* Dai per month: up to 40k/month paid when convenient (Governance Facilitators decision). If the actual Budget Implementation doesn't allow variability in the payment, it will be 40k DAI per month.
