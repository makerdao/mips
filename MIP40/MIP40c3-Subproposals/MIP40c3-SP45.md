## Sentence Summary

MIP40c3-SP#1: adds the DAI budget for the Core Unit MT-001: Maker Talent

## Paragraph Summary

The Maker Talent CU budget is designed with the following goals in mind:

- Paying the DAI compensation to core unit members 
- Sponsoring events where Maker Talent will meet potential candidates and connect with its community
- Paying a part of the referral bonus as an incentive (see MIP39 for details).
- Paying the operational costs of the CU (e.g candidates management software, gas fees and job-ads)
- Keeping reasonable buffer for unexpected expenses (legal, financial and other)

Therefore, a vote to ratify this MIP means MKR holders will commit to:

- Funding a 3 month runway for MT-001
- Replenish the budget on a quarterly basis
- Include members of the Core Unit in the SES MKR Incentive Plan
