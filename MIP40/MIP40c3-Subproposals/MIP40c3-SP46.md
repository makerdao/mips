 ## Sentence Summary

MIP40c3-SP46 adds the DAI budget for Core Unit SF-001: Strategic Finance.

## Paragraph Summary

MIP40c3-SP46 adds the budget for Core Unit SF-001: Strategic Finance. It contains:

- Total Budget Cap: The hard limit voted on by Governance
- First-month forecast: The actual first month estimated expenses
- Breakdown of Permanent Team for the expected first payment (January)

## Specification

### Motivation

Based on the nature of the work done by the Strategic Finance Core Unit (SF-001), the budget reflects the needs of the team to ensure continuity of the work described in our [MIP39c2-SP27](https://github.com/makerdao/mips/blob/master/MIP39/MIP39c2-Subproposals/MIP39c2-SP27.md). This is summarized in, but not limited to:

- Maintaining Financial Statements, Reporting, and existing Dashboards
- Driving alignment and facilitating discussion for Strategic Focus Areas & KPIs
- Tracking, consolidating, and reporting Core Unit expenses to the DAO
- Institutional vault analysis & deal negotiations
- Oracle gas modeling and risk mitigation
- Asset-Liability Management

### Core Unit ID

SF-001

### Budget Implementation

The SF-001 budget is designed with the following in mind:

- Paying for the operational costs to run the core unit
- Having a buffer for unexpected legal, technical, or financial problems

Therefore, a vote to ratify this MIP means MKR holders make a commitment to:

A continuous funding model similar to those proposed by RISK-001, SES-001, and DUX-001. If any modifications are needed, they would be done on a six-month basis through "Modify Core Unit Budget Subproposal Process" (MIP40c3 subproposals.) If modifications are not proposed, the monthly payment amount gets rolled over from the initial proposal, if our work meets community and MKR holders expectations and demands.

### Smart Contract Implementations

- This budget implementation uses the DssVest. This can be changed if needed to any method achieving similar objectives.
- The first vesting budget will be in place from February 2022 to January 2023 included. It will be renewed each year.

A total of 494,502 Dai will be streamed to 0xf737C76D2B358619f7ef696cf3F94548fEcec379 (SF Core Unit Multisig) starting 02/01/22 and ending 07/31/22 at a rate of 82,417 Dai per month.
