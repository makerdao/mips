Core Unit multisig wallet address: "0x3D274fbAc29C92D2F624483495C0113B44dBE7d2"

### Keyholders:

* @PonJerry - “0x9A214CE4c8D490C78bF083939f0e0f3D9e523A56”
* @hexonaut - “0x18CaE82909C31b60Fe0A9656D76406345C9cb9FB”

### One-off Seed

149,692 DAI will be transferred to “0x3D274fbAc29C92D2F624483495C0113B44dBE7d2” on May 1, 2022
2 months operating budget to cover initial startup of financial, upcoming event costs, workshop rental and visual artist retainer

### Monthly Transfers

748,458 DAI will be streamed to “0x3D274fbAc29C92D2F624483495C0113B44dBE7d2” starting 2022-05-01 and ending 2023-04-30 at a rate of 62,371.50 DAI per month

## Budget Breakdown

The yearly budget cap request for the Events Core Unit is 898,150 DAI to support the team's mandate.

This budget cap secures a team of 2 full-time employees (FTE), Event costs, Visual/Design/Lighting Artists retainers, and covers all other operational costs and contingency listed in the table below.  The mandate of the Events CU will be to execute 3 Major events and 2 Minor events per fiscal year.

The budget proposed is a worst-case scenario.  At times based on Maker community feedback, event partnerships with other protocols may be arranged for the event.  During the planning phase, it would be determined how much shared expenses would be passed on to the event partner.  The passed-on expense would be reduced from the event budget cap (Major: 110,000 DAI, Minor: 48,000 DAI) and returned to the Maker protocol.

At the end of the calendar year, all unused funds will be returned to the Maker protocol.  Should the Events Core Unit shut down, all unused funds will be returned to the DAO immediately.

### Visual/Design/Lighting Artist Retainer

Major events will include new visual and lighting elements.  To facilitate the consistency of high-quality visual & lighting elements across all major events, the Events CU budget has included a retainer for a contract visual animator.  The goal is to provide the visual artist with a retainer so the commitment is locked into the entire series of major events for the fiscal year.  By doing so, the CU can ensure quality, consistency and delivery of visual elements for major events.  

The retainer has been calculated based on a daily rate of $555 provided by industry professionals with an estimated workload of 30 days per major event.

### Overhead and Operational cost
* Overhead and operation costs are include the following; 
* Rental for workshop for set dress, lighting and visual building and testing
* Financial & accounting fees
* Social media & promotional digital content costs
* Packaging materials & cases for shipping set dress
* Rental of set dress storage space

### Contingency
The contingency acts as a safety buffer against any unknown or unexpected costs.  The contingency was calculated to be 15% of the entire budget.  Any unused funds would be returned to the Maker protocol.

## Partnerships

The Events CU plans to leverage partnerships with other protocols to offset the event costs.  Our goal for each event is to partner with other protocols to cost split.  As an example 50%-MakerDao, 50%-Partners 1, 25%-Partner 2.  MakerDao would always retain a 50% share minimum and have complete control over the creative direction and the event itself.

To demonstrate how this strategy applies to the requested budget, the following is a breakdown of how the budget would look if the team is successful at cost splitting at all the planned events at 50% MakerDao and 50% Partners.

**Note the following is only for demonstration purposes and not the requested budget for the CU.  We feel this accurately highlights the likely spend scenario of this CU.  We have only included foreseen expenses so have not included the contingency**

| Budgeted Item | Annually | 
| -------- | -------- | 
|FTE Compensation    | $265,000.00    |
|Major Event 1 (50% share of requested budget)    | $55,000.00   |
|Major Event 2 (1200-1400 attendees)    | $55,000.00   |
|Major Event 3 (1200-1400 attendees)    | $55,000.00   | 
|Minor Event 1 (300-400 attendees)    | $24,000.00   |
|Minor Event 2 (300-400 attendees)    | $24,000.00   |
|Visual/Design/Lighting Artist Retainer    | $50,000.00  |
|Overhead & Operation Costs    | $40,000.00  | 
|||
|**Total**    | **$568,000.00**  |
|||

Under this strategy, the sum of **$330,150.00** from the requested budget would be returned to the DAO.
