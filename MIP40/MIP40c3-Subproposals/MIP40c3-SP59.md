## Sentence Summary

MIP40c3-SP59 adds a 12-month DAI budget of 1,109,793 DAI for the GovAlpha Core Unit starting in April 2022.

## Paragraph Summary

MIP40c3-SP59 adds a 12-month DAI budget of 1,109,793 DAI for the GovAlpha Core Unit starting in April 2022. This will be implemented via a 89,983 DAI per month stream and an initial transfer of 30,000 DAI.

## Specification

### Motivation

We are proposing this Core Unit Budget modification because GovAlpha requires an operating budget to fulfill its mandate. Now and in the future we will be proposing annual DAI budgets due to our greater experience running GovAlpha and in an attempt to push MakerDAO core units toward a standard of annual DAI budgets.

### Core Unit ID

GovAlpha (GOV-001)

### Year-Ahead Plans

For each quarter we are defining major and minor project focuses. In addition to these items, we continue to operate existing processes and support other related CUs in their projects by providing feedback and guidance.

We have only defined 6 minor items, as we want to have some flexibility to react to new priorities that appear during the next year. These items may shuffle around if and when priorities change.

#### Q2-2022

##### Major: Prioritization Voting Algorithm

MakerDAO lacks an accessible and effective method to comparatively determine priorities for a given set of items. We will examine the available options in terms of voting algorithms, identify strengths and weaknesses of each algorithm and will make a recommendation to Governance to adopt one algorithm for general use.

We will work with DUX-001 to implement said algorithm. Once operational and tested, this will be available to governance to help:

- Prioritize cross-Core Unit initiatives.
- Determine direction for MakerDAO on specific issues.
- Determine the importance and ranking of shared values for MakerDAO.

##### Minor: Formalizing Recognised Delegates

Recognised Delegates and Shadow Delegates are not currently defined in MIP format. We believe it would be useful to formalize the motivations towards the current delegate system, and agree on the requirements for individuals to become recognised delegates.

This will join the Delegate Compensation MIP currently being developed and will form the delegates MIP set. 

##### Minor: Experimenting with Off-chain Incentives

MakerDAO currently uses SourceCred to reward engagement in the official forum. We will investigate and trial alternative configurations of SourceCred, and non-SourceCred initiatives in an attempt to achieve the goals of:

- Retaining interested community members by providing ‘bridging’ compensation that makes engagement worth the cost in the hope that members will take up a more formal role in MakerDAO.
- Increasing the number of relevant and useful MIP and signal request submissions. 

#### Q3-2022

##### Major: Governance Audit + Analysis

In order to effectively measure any improvements to governance at MakerDAO, we first need to determine a set of metrics that can be used to judge the effectiveness of Maker Governance. Now that we’ve implemented much of the low-hanging fruit, and have witnessed stable and consistent MKR weight participation in proposals, we can spend the time required to do this properly.

We will also review the effectiveness of governance thus far against these same metrics and produce some forward-looking analysis of commonly proposed governance initiatives and estimate which would be most beneficial to governance in MakerDAO.

##### Minor: Maker Operational Manual Updates

We’ll take some time in Q3 to do an update and maintenance pass on the Maker Operational Manual. It’s still early days for this platform, but we may schedule something like this roughly every 6 months to ensure that the information remains correct and accessible.

##### Minor: Delivering CatFlipLike Status UI

We have been contracting with dSpot to produce a parameter-focused status UI that we’re currently calling CatFlipLike, given that it’s similar to the now defunct catflip UI. 

There is still some amount of development work still to go on this project before it can be considered complete. We expect an initial version to be released prior to Q3, but we aim to have made it feature-complete by Q3.

#### Q4-2022

##### Major: Separation of Powers Framework

Separation of Powers has been brought up several times with respect to Maker with the goal of controlling and limiting the risk of the DAO being corrupted in the longer-term by malicious or selfish actors.

We will deliver a lightweight Separation of Powers framework for MakerDAO in Q4 2022, including one or more explanatory forum posts and a MIP set. 

##### Minor: Forum Plugin Experimentation

We have been wanting to experiment with the discourse forum for some time, but have previously not been able to find someone willing to spend time on it. We believe we’ve made progress in this regard, and we’re hoping to have some experimental plugin changes live by Q4 2022.

##### Minor: Emergency Preparedness

Although there has been an initiative for emergency preparedness active for some time, we believe that there is still room to improve and prepare processes and resources for MakerDAO in the event of an emergency.

We will set aside time to work on this in Q4 2022, and trust that any emergencies will be scheduled subsequent to this date.

#### Q1-2023

##### Major: MIPs Cleanup and Tightening

Over the past year or so, we’ve seen several changes to the structure and processes within MakerDAO as part of the gradual decentralization process. Unfortunately this has left us in a situation when a number of the older MIPs are no longer fully relevant and should be removed, amended or replaced. 

We will spend some time on these in Q1 2023. Once we are at a point where we consider the MIPs to be consistent, correct and effective, we may tighten up the existing governance processes such that the MIPs are enforced more consistently across all authors.

### Facilitator Pay Matrix

| Base Pay | 126,000 |
|----------|---------|

|                          | Multiplier | Explanation                                                                   |
|--------------------------|------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Commitment - Partial     |        0.8 | Part Time commitment, 20 hours per week minimum.                              |
| Commitment - Full        |          1 | Full Time commitment, 35 hours a week minimum.                                |
| Experience - Limited     |        0.7 | New to the role, would not be able to fulfill responsibilities alone.         |
| Experience - Moderate    |          1 | Confident in the role, capable of fulfilling critical responsibilities alone. |
| Experience - Experienced |        1.5 | Experienced in the role, capable of fulfilling all responsibilities alone.    |

|                          | Partial Commitment | Full Commitment |
|--------------------------|--------------------|-----------------|
| Experience - Limited     |         70,560 DAI |      88,200 DAI |
| Experience - Moderate    |        100,800 DAI |     126,000 DAI |
| Experience - Experienced |        151,200 DAI |     189,000 DAI |


Note that there are two changes here from previous budgets:

- Base Pay has increased by 5% to help offset U.S dollar inflation.
- The ‘Experience - Limited’ modifier has slightly increased. This reflects a realization that by the time contributors are onboarded as facilitators, they tend to have more experience than we’d initially assumed.

### Team Membership
At the time of writing the GovAlpha team consists of the following members. 

-- Facilitators --
@LongForWisdom - Partial Commitment - Facilitator - Experienced
@prose11 - Full Commitment - Facilitator - Moderate Experience

--MIP Editors--
@blimpa - Full Time - MIP Editor

--Contributors--
@Patrick_J - Part Time Contributor 
@Gala - Part Time Contributor
@Sebix - Part Time Contributor
@AstronautThis - Part Time Contributor
@TheExistence - Part Time Contributor
@Hernandoagf - Part Time Contributor

GovAlpha remains primarily composed of part-time contributors working under flexible hours. We try to reflect the spirit of the DAO internally, meaning that we encourage our workforce to take assignments and projects that interest them.

### Budget Notes

#### Compensation

- We’re budgeting for a third governance facilitator starting in Q3 2022. We have an idea of who we would like to put forward as the third facilitator and will make this public at a later date.
- Facilitator and contributor pay has been increased by 5% to offset increasing inflation of the US dollar.
- We’ve estimated a small increase in contributor FTE’s over the year anticipating a small increase in workload as the DAO increases in size and complexity.

#### Contingency

- Contingency = Funds budgeted but not for any particular use, to cover unforeseen circumstances and opportunities.
- We’ve budgeted contingency as 15% of our total budget (excluding continuity) for the year.
- This is higher than our previous budget and reflects the increased level of uncertainty over the longer budget period. 

#### Travel

- We’ve calculated travel assuming that there will be 10 instances of GovAlpha sending facilitators or contributors to events over the year. 
- For event planning costs, we’ve budgeted for GovAlpha paying a share towards up to three events over the year, given the lack of an event-focused core unit. These funds will be made available to any core unit planning Maker-themed events or side-events at major conferences. 

#### Software Development

- We are continuing to fund dSpot to create the CatFlipLike status UI, and have budgeted some funds for them to continue maintenance and polish work on the MIPs Portal.
- We are continuing to fund the maintenance and development of the daistats UI.

#### Continuity

- Continuity = Money to be used to keep the core unit operational for 3 months in the event of a lack of funding due to an emergency in the Maker Protocol. May also be used to meet obligations if the GovAlpha Core Unit is offboarded by governance.
- We are increasing our total continuity pool to 180,000 DAI to adjust for the larger compensation budget item this year. This is an increase of 30,000 DAI.

A total of 1,079,793 DAI will be streamed to [0x01D26f8c5cC009868A4BF66E268c17B057fF7A73](https://etherscan.io/address/0x2cc583c0aacdac9e23cb601fda8f1a0c56cdcb71) starting at 2022-04-01 and ending at 2023-04-01. 

##### 2. Manual Budget Implementation

A transfer of DAI from the Maker Protocol to the GovAlpha Multisig will be included in an executive vote as part of the weekly governance cycle.

30,000 DAI will be transferred to [0x01D26f8c5cC009868A4BF66E268c17B057fF7A73](https://etherscan.io/address/0x2cc583c0aacdac9e23cb601fda8f1a0c56cdcb71) on  2022-04-01.

This manual budget implementation covers the continuity portion of the proposed budget.
