GovAlpha (GOV-001)

### Quarterly Focus

#### Delegation

#### Education

#### Quality Assurance

### Team Membership
The GovAlpha Team will consist of at least the following members in the July/August/September budget period.

**-- Facilitators --**  
@LongForWisdom - Partial Commitment - Facilitator - Experienced  
@prose11 - Full Commitment - Facilitator - Limited Experience*  

**--MIP Editors--**  
@blimpa - Full Time - MIP Editor*  
@charlesstlouis - Part Time -  MIP Editor  

**--Contributors--**  
@Elihu - Full Time - Governance Core Unit Contributor  
_Unfilled_ - Part Time PM / Operations  
_Unfilled_ - Part Time Contributor

### Quarterly Budget - June/August/September

#### Facilitator Remuneration

**There is no change to this section compared to the previous quarter**

Remuneration for Facilitators of GovAlpha will be an annual salary paid monthly. The size of the annual salary will begin at a base rate that is equal for all facilitators and is then modified based on the level of the individual facilitator's time commitment and experience. 

The multiplier for partial commitment is higher than one might initially expect given the hours contributed compared to a full-time commitment. This is because facilitators with a partial commitment have the same requirements to be available in emergency situations and take an equal share of responsibility when fulfilling the GovAlpha mandate.

#### Breakdown

#### Remarks

### Budget Implementation

**To be completed**

Assuming that Payton Rose (@prose11) will be confirmed as facilitator, we will setup a GovAlpha multi-sig wallet that will be owned by governance and administered by GovAlpha facilitators for the purpose of funding the operations of the GovAlpha core unit. The details of this wallet will be shared once it has been set up.

In the event of Payton Rose (@prose11) failing to be ratified as a facilitator of GovAlpha, the Core Unit will continue to use the Interim DAO Multi-sig wallet located at this address **0x73f09254a81e1F835Ee442d1b3262c1f1d7A13ff** that was used for te previous quarter.
