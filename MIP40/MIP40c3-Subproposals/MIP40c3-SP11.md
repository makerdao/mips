## Sentence Summary

MIP40c3-SPX adds the budget for Core Unit GOV-001: GovAlpha.

## Paragraph Summary
MIP40c3-SPX adds the budget for Core Unit GOV-001: GovAlpha. This budget proposal covers the months of July, August, and September of 2021. It communicates three focuses for GovAlpha over the period: Delegation, Education and Quality Assurance. GovAlpha is asking for a total of 532,750 DAI this quarter - 382,750 DAI will cover operations while 150,000 DAI will remain in a GovAlpha administered multi-sig wallet to ensure emergency continuity. 

### Motivation

I am proposing this Core Unit Budget modification because GovAlpha requires an operating budget in order to be able to fulfill its mandate.

### Core Unit Name
GovAlpha (GOV-001)

### Quarterly Focus

#### Delegation

Delegation has always been a longer-term focus for the development of governance within MakerDAO. Given recent events and the need to have delegates operating effectively as soon as possible, this is something GovAlpha plans to focus on over the next quarter. 

We are hoping to launch delegation at Maker in a structured and effective way that allows MKR Holders to choose one or more delegate that they feel is compatible with their views. GovAlpha aims to promote delegates that opt-in to a lightweight framework that sets some guidelines for delegates to follow.The aim here is to create a tradition of communication and transparency around delegates within MakerDAO - hopefully leading to a more predictable and efficient process for decision-making as governance evolves.

GovAlpha will also attempt to convince larger MKR token holders to delegate some portion of their MKR holdings to the public delegates that opt-in to this lightweight framework. We believe that this will lead to more MKR active in governance and more thorough debate.

Subsequent to the launch of delegation, we plan to continue to organise and deliver improvements and integration of delegate functionality into the voting portal.

#### Education

Proper educational knowledge is essential for newer participants to vote and engage effectively in governance at MakerDAO. As such, we are prioritizing getting easily accessible educational materials out to the community this quarter. We will focus our educational efforts in three key areas:
- Ongoing development of the Maker Operational Manual. 
- Expansion of Parameter Documentation for Liquidations 2.0 and RWA terms.
- Adding educational content to the [MIPs Portal](https://mips.makerdao.com/). 

We plan to work with the Content Productions Core Unit to create high-quality educational materials that are visually inviting and easy to engage with for newer users. 

#### Quality Assurance

As the DAO grows and governance decisions become more meaningful and impactful, it is critical that governance continues both smoothly and effectively. To this end, we feel that we should spend some time and effort on ensuring quality across the governance processes that GovAlpha operates. It is easy to fall into habits and 'grooves' with certain processes which can lead to them to continue to operate in a sub-optimal manner past the point where they should be improved.

For the polling and executive processes, we aim to improve templates and voting portal user-interface to deliver information in the most intuitive and consumable way possible to voters. 

For the signalling process we want to improve accessibility and guidelines to make this process simple and easy for governance participants to use effectively. 

We've also noticed some opportunities for improvement in time management and prioritization within GovAlpha, and we will be making an effort to make improvements here as well. Our aim is to ensure that our time is spent effectively and that deliverables are met consistently and with high quality.

### Team Membership
The GovAlpha Team will consist of at least the following members in the July/August/September budget period.

**-- Facilitators --**  
@LongForWisdom - Partial Commitment - Facilitator - Experienced  
@prose11 - Full Commitment - Facilitator - Limited Experience*  

**--MIP Editors--**  
@blimpa - Full Time - MIP Editor*  
@charlesstlouis - Part Time -  MIP Editor  

**--Contributors--**  
@Elihu - Full Time - Governance Core Unit Contributor  
_Unfilled_ - Part Time PM / Operations  
_Unfilled_ - Part Time Contributor

### Quarterly Budget - June/August/September

#### Facilitator Remuneration

**There is no change to this section compared to the previous quarter**

Remuneration for Facilitators of GovAlpha will be an annual salary paid monthly. The size of the annual salary will begin at a base rate that is equal for all facilitators and is then modified based on the level of the individual facilitator's time commitment and experience. 

The multiplier for partial commitment is higher than one might initially expect given the hours contributed compared to a full-time commitment. This is because facilitators with a partial commitment have the same requirements to be available in emergency situations and take an equal share of responsibility when fulfilling the GovAlpha mandate.

#### Remarks

**Contingency Buffer**

Once again GovAlpha is including a not-insignificant contingency buffer. While we do feel slightly more confident about the operations of the Core Unit with a few months of experience gained, we remain concerned about the rapid pace of development within the DAO, and we wish to be prepared to take advantage of any opportunities that present themselves. 

**Continuity Budget**

We are requesting a portion of this quarter's budget allocation for the specific purposes of continued operation during a serious event that cuts off monthly budget transfers to GovAlpha. The DAI from this allocation will likely be swapped for USDC to further protect the Core Unit's ability to pay for essential services during an event that makes spending DAI unfeasible.

150,000 DAI would allow for us to continue paying essential salaries and core expenses without defaulting on payments for previous work. These funds will only be used when GovAlpha cannot receive monthly budget payments from the protocol. 

### Budget Implementation

**To be completed**

Assuming that Payton Rose (@prose11) will be confirmed as facilitator, we will setup a GovAlpha multi-sig wallet that will be owned by governance and administered by GovAlpha facilitators for the purpose of funding the operations of the GovAlpha core unit. The details of this wallet will be shared once it has been set up.

In the event of Payton Rose (@prose11) failing to be ratified as a facilitator of GovAlpha, the Core Unit will continue to use the Interim DAO Multi-sig wallet located at this address **0x73f09254a81e1F835Ee442d1b3262c1f1d7A13ff** that was used for te previous quarter.
