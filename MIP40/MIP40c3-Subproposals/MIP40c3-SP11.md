## Paragraph Summary
**To be completed**  
MIP40c3-SP11 adds the budget for Core Unit GOV-001: GovAlpha. This budget proposal covers the months of July, August, and September of 2021. It communicates three focuses for GovAlpha over the quarter: Delegation, Education and Quality Assurance. GovAlpha is asking for a budget of...

### Motivation

I am proposing this Core Unit Budget modification because GovAlpha requires an operating budget in order to be able to fulfill its mandate.

### Core Unit Name
GovAlpha (GOV-001)

### Quarterly Focus

#### Delegation

#### Education

Proper educational knowledge is essential to being able to participate in Maker Governance. As such, we are prioritizing getting easily accessible educational materials out to the community this quarter. We will focus our educational efforts in three key areas:
- Ongoing development of the Maker Operational Manual 
- Expansion of Parameter Documentation for Liquidations 2.0 and RWA terms
- Adding educational content to the [MIPs Portal](mips.makerdao.com) 

We plan to work closely with the Content Productions Core Unit to ensure our educational materials are of the highest quality and are visually inviting from a newer-user perspective. 


#### Quality Assurance

### Team Membership
The GovAlpha Team will consist of at least the following members in the July/August/September budget period.

**-- Facilitators --**  
@LongForWisdom - Partial Commitment - Facilitator - Experienced  
@prose11 - Full Commitment - Facilitator - Limited Experience*  

**--MIP Editors--**  
@blimpa - Full Time - MIP Editor*  
@charlesstlouis - Part Time -  MIP Editor  

**--Contributors--**  
@Elihu - Full Time - Governance Core Unit Contributor  
_Unfilled_ - Part Time PM / Operations  
_Unfilled_ - Part Time Contributor  
_Unfilled_ - Part Time Contributor  

### Quarterly Budget - June/August/September

#### Facilitator Remuneration

**There is no change to this section compared to the previous quarter**

Remuneration for Facilitators of GovAlpha will be an annual salary paid monthly. The size of the annual salary will begin at a base rate that is equal for all facilitators and is then modified based on the level of the individual facilitator's time commitment and experience. 

The multiplier for partial commitment is higher than one might initially expect given the hours contributed compared to a full-time commitment. This is because facilitators with a partial commitment have the same requirements to be available in emergency situations and take an equal share of responsibility when fulfilling the GovAlpha mandate.

#### Remarks

**Continuity Budget**

We are requesting a portion of this quarter's budget allocation for the specific purposes of continued operation during a serious event that cuts off monthly budget transfers to GovAlpha. The DAI from this allocation will likely be swapped for USDC to further protect the Core Unit's ability to pay for essential services during an event that makes spending DAI unfeasible. 150,000 DAI would allow for us to continue paying essential salaries and core expenses without defaulting on payments for previous work. These funds will only be used when GovALpha cannot receive monthly budget payments from the protocol. 

### Budget Implementation

**To be completed**

Assuming that Payton Rose (@prose11) will be confirmed as facilitator, we will setup a GovAlpha multi-sig wallet that will be owned by governance and administered by GovAlpha facilitators for the purpose of funding the operations of the GovAlpha core unit. The details of this wallet will be shared once it has been set up.

In the event of Payton Rose (@prose11) failing to be ratified as a facilitator of GovAlpha, the Core Unit will continue to use the Interim DAO Multi-sig wallet located at this address **0x73f09254a81e1F835Ee442d1b3262c1f1d7A13ff** that was used for te previous quarter.
