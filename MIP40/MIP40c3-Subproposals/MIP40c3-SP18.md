## Sentence Summary

MIP40c3-SP18 adds the budget for Core Unit CPM-001: Strategic Marcomms 

## Specification

### Motivation

The unit seeks to accelerate the growth of MakerDAO by providing a cohesive global branding with a strong focus on collaboration and coordination.

## Core Unit Name

Strategic Marcomms
CPM-001

## Budget

The budget is roughly 2.9 percent of the Maker protocol’s revenue (based on Makerburn estimate as of June), which is below the industry average of [10 percent](https://deloitte.wsj.com/cmo/2017/01/24/who-has-the-biggest-marketing-budgets/). Together with PR communications, marketing communications function as revenue drivers.

The proposed budget is based on industry data and estimates made after consulting with experts and service providers from finance, accounting, legal, marketing, and PR. The budget consists of the following:

**People:**

The Strategic Marcomms unit consists of individuals with many years of experience in marketing and PR. They are professionals who possess the know-how and in-depth knowledge of cryptocurrencies and understand the complexity of marketing in the crypto space. The estimates are within the compensation range stated in reports published by HR consulting agencies based on job levels and experience.

The table below gives an overview of the number of people who plan to join the unit and the number of people we need to hire.

* Marketing includes contributors focusing on marketing, events, and community building.
* PR, Communications, and Content include media outreach, PR agency management, content coordination, and written content.
