## Sentence Summary

MIP40c3-SP9 adds the budget for Core Unit CPM-001: Strategic Marcomms

## Specification
## Motivation

The Strategic Marcomms unit, formed by a team of experienced professionals, plays a vital role in representing the MakerDAO brand in the eyes of potential users and partners.

The complexity of the products and undefined regulatory frameworks in major jurisdictions in the cryptocurrency sector means the team has to be diligent communicators capable of executing marketing plans while being mindful of the potential concerns of users and regulators.

I am proposing this budget to take the groundwork built by the foundation and drive it forward. My unit ensures MakerDAO reaches its full potential by tapping into new markets and boosting visibility in existing ones. We will be the face of MakerDAO for new users and partners.

My team consists of diverse individuals who are multilingual. Their international background and level of experience inject strength and brings value to the team. That diversity is essential as we present Dai as an unbiased currency, and position MakerDAO as a way to unlock financial freedom for anyone, anywhere.

The stablecoin market with a $60 billion market cap has surged exponentially in the past year, where Dai accounts for 5 percent of the market share. The team will focus on this fast-growing market and new target growth areas while collaborating with other units in reaching the common goal of bringing Dai to the level of mass adoption.

### Core Unit Name

[Strategic Marcomms](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/mip39c2-strategic-marcomms-core-unit/7189)

### Budget Composition

On average, marketing budgets account for about [10 percent](https://deloitte.wsj.com/cmo/2017/01/24/who-has-the-biggest-marketing-budgets/) of a company's revenue. Together with the PR communications, they function as revenue drivers.

The proposed budget is based on industry data and estimates made after consulting with experts and service providers in finance, accounting, legal, marketing, and PR. The budget encompasses key areas of coverage, and some initiatives such as outreach programs are scheduled to be activated in the second and third quarters.

The budget is about 8.2 percent of the Maker protocol's revenue (based on estimates from the first two months of the year), below the 10 percent average. The below-average estimate is made regardless of additional costs unique to MakerDAO units, such as legal consultation and the team's operation cost. A lower than average budget shows that the unit is ambitious, ready to execute its plan, and simultaneously realistic of what can be achieved in one year.
