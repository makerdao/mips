## Sentence Summary

MIP40c3-SP33 adds the budget for Core Unit MKT-001: Content Production for December 2021 through May 2022.

## Paragraph Summary

MIP40c3-SP33 adds the budget for Core Unit MKT-001: Content Production for December 2021 through May 2022. We are requesting a 6-month budget allocation of 424,944 DAI.

## Motivation

We’re proposing this Core Unit Budget modification to provide funds for the Content Production team to continue fulfilling its mandate. We’re proposing to move from a 3-month budget cycle to a 6-month budget cycle, as the tight turnaround on a 3-month cycle makes it difficult to assess needs and provide transparency, and we feel we’ve started proving ourselves as a Core Unit.

## Core Unit Name

Content Production (MKT-001)

##### November - January Focus

Looking back at the [Quarterly Focus](https://github.com/makerdao/mips/blob/master/MIP40/MIP40c3-Subproposals/MIP40c3-SP21.md#quarterly-focus) from our last budget proposal, we’ve conducted content audits of the [Portal](https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_l0vK27E=/) and [makerdao.com](https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_l0vLTC0=/) to plan what content should live where. We’ll begin implementing those plans to sync the content across those properties as well as the Community and makerdao.com blogs when we gain access to these channels.

We’ve focused on publishing content on [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/MakerDAO/), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/MakerMegaphone), and [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/c/MakerDAO/videos) until we can get access to the accounts currently with the Dai Foundation and anticipate that happening once an Asset Allocation MIP is passed.

###### Explainer Videos

The team put together a plan to produce animated [explainer videos](https://docs.google.com/document/d/191PU8wMkm3BB2pOkbJLgLu1xPA6dk4pCId-mArlB-1M/edit) to help new community members get up-to-speed on the inner workings of MakerDAO and drive SEO on Youtube.

These will consist of 2-5 minute animated videos organized to help people understand governance, liquidation, collateral onboarding, and system parameters.

Animations for a 3-5 minute explainer can take two weeks per video but certain elements can also be recycled for different videos and we’re proposing to bring on an Assistant Video Producer so we can speed the production of explainer videos and continue producing other video content when needed.

###### Community

To help address concerns in the community about MakerDAO’s marketing program, we’re proposing to conduct a pilot to resurrect MakerDAO’s Ambassador Program and bring on two new full-time roles to coordinate Press Relations and Marketing Strategy.

At the suggestion of the @Growth-Core-Unit, @kat will be coordinating a pilot to resurrect MakerDAO’s Ambassador Program. The pilot will focus on Latin America and involve building regional teams to host meetups, manage localized social media accounts, moderate communications channels, and generally help MakerDAO gain recognition in different parts of the world.

The Content team has been approached about doing Press Relations and hasn’t felt like we’ve had the bandwidth to manage it effectively, but we believe it would be a valuable tool in communicating what’s happening at MakerDAO with the wider crypto ecosystem.

Last but not least, several teams (notably GovAlpha and Protocol Engineering) have expressed the desire for a marketing team that they can go to in order to help promote new products/services/initiatives.

For now, we’re proposing to bring on a marketing strategist to field these requests and either help the Content team expand to accommodate the DAO’s needs with regard to marketing, or form a Core Unit focused on general marketing.

###### Research

The brand research we’ve been working on (see the [Announcement](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/participate-in-brand-research-support-marketing-efforts-for-makerdao/9341) and [Initial Results](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/informal-poll-brand-research-results-seeking-opinions-on-new-messaging/10020) and schedule an interview [here](http://calendly.com/humansofmaker)) will be an ongoing study to help inform our messaging and help the DAO understand how people think about MakerDAO. We plan to incorporate this into market research to gain more insights into the reasons people use Vaults and Dai.

##### February - May Focus

Depending on how things go with the Ambassador Program pilot and our Marketing Strategist, we’ll be looking to expand the Ambassador Program beyond Latin America into advantageous regions where communications can be difficult due to: A) language barrier and B) differences in primary social channels.

In addition to explainer videos, the team has talked about coordinating professional video recording for larger sponsored events once there’s more certainty around travel. We’ve also discussed collaborating with Ambassadors on closed captioning or doing voice-overs in foreign languages to expand the reach of explainer videos.

This budget also includes funds for two travel opportunities so the team can represent MakerDAO at conferences and meet fellow team members.

### Modifications

After reviewing our accounting, we’ve updated our budget proposal with a more accurate view of our needs and to reflect that the budget will now apply for December to May. Thanks @PaperImperium and @Aes for encouraging us to take a closer look at our books.

With regard to salaries, we’ve carried forward a surplus of 51,056 Dai mostly accrued during our first couple of months with hiring.

We’ve also added 38,000 Dai to replenish the funds we’ll take from our Continuity buffer to get through November, 8,000 Dai to replenish our Contingency funds (we’ve spent 3000 on insurance and 5000 on legal fees), and reduced the funds for the Ambassador Program from 10,000 to 7,000 Dai due to a surplus in the Community Management funds from the last budget period.
