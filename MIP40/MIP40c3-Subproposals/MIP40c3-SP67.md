## Specification

### Motivation

> Due to foreseeable circumstances (yet again!) I have torched my personal trading account.

That said, I am still extremely bullish on MakerDAO, its future, and the future of DAI. Maker and its community have truly become my second family. In my darkest times, you have all been there for me. You have all shown me that you genuinely care for me and each other. That is rare in this world!

I am infinitely grateful to all of you. You've opened doors for me that I never imagined existed. Just being part of the MakerDAO community has brought me untold opportunities.

I initially started the Strategic Happiness Core Unit as a bit of a meme, but it has grown into so much more since then. At the time, I was doing quite well financially, so I did not request a salary or a vest. I just wanted to see our project do well and be part of its success.

While I am fully aware that I have been in and out in regards to participation as of late, I still do my best to stick to my original mandate! Make everyone happy!  :)

After the success of ETHDenver, DAIVinity, those Beanies, North Faces, and backpacks (apologies to all that may not have gotten something from me yet!), I believe our community is seeing the value that I bring.

Despite all that, I've realized that running the SHCU alone is simply not possible.

**I would like to propose a budget that will allow me to truly scale my operations.**

Going forward, I plan to:
- Start an account with AccountAble.
    - With their help, I will begin properly managing expenses and more definitively separating personal expenditures from business expenditures.
    - *Note: As of today, 2022-03-09, I have already funded an account from my current budget. So, even if this budget update does not pass, I am already set up with their services.*
- Set up a proper multi-sig for my CU's budget.
- Hire @kat as my first employee.
    - She will (and already has been) help with coordination, design, accounting, swag distribution, and much much more!  : )
- Potentially hire one more person for assistance:
    - Ultimately, this may or may not be necessary, but we shall see as things progress.
- Set up a *new* Official Maker Swag Shop
    - Sorry, @coulter!
    - @kat will help me do it.
    - This will require some legal framework and one-time start-up costs to fill the inventory.
    - It should generate revenue for the SHCU, and, if very successful, will offset many other costs.
    - The shop will feature general items people can order at any time and go out through drop shippers.
    - Limited edition items will not really be available there, though. If you want that *reallyyy* unique thing, you'll have to get it from me directly. : )
- Create MUCH more swag, with a lot more creativity and higher quality.
- Distribute at all major events and conferences.
    - Despite all the doubters, our beanies were remarkably popular at ETHDenver!
- Participate in partially co-funding and curating some of the events hosted by the new Events Core Unit.
    - DAIVinity has given AAVE a run for its money! : )
    - "Maker is cool again!"
        - David Hoffman, Bankless
- Continue to promote our brand and its image in the space.

#### Facilitator

As the Facilitator of the Strategic Happiness Core Unit, it’s been my job to raise the morale of our community and get others outside our community excited about Maker and DAI.

Initially, I proposed a salary of 0 DAI for myself. It was a unique way to get involved, and I know everyone got a kick out of it too : )

I would like to continue doing what I do. It’s fun, and doing it for free was cool. However, lately, many have urged me to get paid for my efforts. I’ve heard all kinds of numbers suggested. Some relatively high, some lower… and some have suggested calling it a “stipend.”

In light of that, for this budget update, and given my plans for expanding, I’m proposing what I believe might be a reasonable sum. Of course, during the RFC phase, I’m open to discussions on revising it in either direction : )

### Budget Breakdown

#### Salaries

The new team will have one full-time Facilitator and one full-time employee.

#### Compensation

Both @kat and I will be employees of AccountAble.

Annual compensation will be:

- **Andrew Burban:** 140,000 DAI
- **Katherine Obermeyer:** 140,000 DAI

**Note:** I have revised our compensations down based on comments from @psychonaut, below. There is no shot that either of us deserves to be paid a higher salary than @longforwisdom. That said, given how much he contributes to our community, in my opinion, he is severely underpaid. Anyway, I hope this little reduction makes the budget more palatable.

#### Healthcare

To align with traditional company offerings, this proposal includes a healthcare supplement averaging $1250/month for full-time employees.

#### Contingency Buffer

I've added a standard buffer for incidentals.

#### Travel

I am requesting a quarterly budget of 18,000 Dai for travel.

- This will allow us to attend Maker, ETH, and other worldwide crypto events.
- The budget will cover flights, lodging, food, etc.

#### Ongoing Operations

- Operational Overhead
- AccountAble
- TokenTax
- CRM Software
- Bookkeeping
- Accounting
- Legal
- Transportation
- Software
- Miscellaneous Costs

#### Swag Shop Breakdown

This is an optional item, but I believe it is worthwhile for us to have an operational Swag Shop. I know I was offered to take over the previous Swag Shop from Mike & Coulter. It might be viable to work together with them to set up a new one (borrow ideas and such), but I think it’s probably better to start fresh. It requires a light legal framework of some kind, and some start-up costs, which Kat is experienced with.

Once it’s operational, it should generate some light revenue stream, which would offset the Core Unit’s overall costs and possibly even be profitable enough to stream revenue to the DAO. All profits and revenue from this shop will remain within the CU budget or be returned to the DAO. Neither Kat nor I will be personally profiting from this, no matter how well it does.

#### Clarifications

##### Unused Funds

Unused funds will be credited towards the next quarter's budget.

##### Potential Future Hires

Currently, this budget only includes compensation for myself and Kat. If we discover that we need more help down the road, there should be enough slack in the budget to start someone off with an entry salary of some kind. In that case, I would revise the budget up at a later date, but I do not want to request funds for that since I currently don’t have any plans to hire anyone else.

## Budget Request Up-Front

For the next funding cycle, I am requesting funding up-front, as follows:

| Description | Amount |
| --- | ---:
|Quarterly Budget| 261,000 DAI |
|Swag Shop Setup | 135,000 DAI |
| **Total** | **396,000 DAI** |
|||

## MKR Vesting

The Strategic Happiness Core Unit proposes to vest its members with MKR to further align incentives.

MKR will be vested over a four-year vesting period, with a one-year cliff.

Vesting is proposed as follows:

- **Andrew Burban:** 250 MKR
- **Katherine Obermeyer:** 250 MKR
- **New Hires:** TBD

> By this point, I believe both Kat and I have proven ourselves to be such core members of the MakerDAO community that vesting us with this modest amount of MKR is warranted. Maker is our passion, a part of our identity, and the entire community is pretty much our family. That said, if community feedback is overwhelmingly unsupportive, I am prepared to make adjustments during the RFC phase.

Contrary to other linear vesting schedules that are going around, I would like to propose a different kind of unlock scheme for our vesting. Kat and I both plan to stay with MakerDAO for the *very* long haul. The unlock schedule I’m proposing below has us unlock very little at first. The majority of our MKR unlocks towards the end of the four-year vesting period. If we leave early, we abandon the majority of our vest.

### MKR Vesting Schedule

| Date | % | Total |
| --- | --- | --- |
| April 2023 | 2.5% | 6.25 MKR |
| October 2023 | 2.5% | 6.25 MKR |
| April 2024 | 5% | 12.5 MKR |
| October 2024 | 5% | 12.5 MKR |
| April 2025 | 15% | 37.5 MKR |
| October 2025 | 20% | 50 MKR |
| April 2026 | 20% | 50 MKR |
| October 2026 | 30% | 75 MKR |

### MKR Vesting Details

|Property|Value|
| --- | --- |
| MKR Lock-In Price | 🤷‍♂️ |
| Biannual MKR Amount | See Schedule Above (x2) |
| Vesting Period | 4 years|
| Cliff Vest | 12 Months |
| Vesting Schedule | After the cliff has expired, MKR vests every 6 months and is distributed every April & October 1st |
| Manual Repricing | Yes |
| Auto-Renewal | Yes |
| Estimated Total After 1 Year (2 FTE) | 25 MKR |
| Estimated Total After 4 Years (2 FTE) | 500 |

This covers the total vesting schedule of `4 Years` for the planned `2 FTEs`.

#### MKR Payment Implementation

- **Payment:** Based on predetermined MKR compensation schedule.
- **Asset Type:** MKR
- **Addresses:** TBD
