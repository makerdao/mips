## Sentence Summary

End streaming of new funds and vesting of MKR to DECO on May 31st.

## Paragraph Summary

If approved, DECOs budget(MIP40c3-SP35 and MIP40c3-SP36) will end on May 31st. This will end streaming of new funds and vesting of MKR to DECO CU members.

## Specification

- Stop streaming of Dai to DECO on May 31st.
- End vesting of MKR to DECO CU members on May 31st.
- Remaining funds in DECO controlled wallets will be returned to MakerDAO on May 31st.

### Motivation

In 2021, DECO was given a 3 year budget. There have been considerable shifts in the needs and resources of the DAO since it was approved, along with DECO's changing role in the context of the endgame.

The CU's budget and goals should be reevaluated, so I propose ending their current budget in May. This will give DECO time to propose a new budget and new goals that best uses MakerDAO's scarce resources and technical talent.

### Core Unit ID

DECO-001
