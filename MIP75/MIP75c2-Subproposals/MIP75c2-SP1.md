## Description

The Growth Task Force aims to grow the Maker ecosystem as fast as possible. It is our view that we are in a nascent stage of crypto, and controlling as much future market share as possible is critical for the survival of this project.

Our focus is on practical solutions to achieve the objectives listed below as quickly as possible. Perfection is the enemy of progress. We aim to find solutions that work first and backfill decentralization / resilience later.

### Short-Term Objectives

1. Capital raise to solve cash flow problems and increase surplus buffer to improve risk tolerance. This may be done through a combination of equity and debt instruments.
2. Multi-chain expansion to grow our user base with a focus on meeting retail users where they are/going to be. This includes boosting DAI liquidity on as many chains as possible.
3. Positioning Maker as a credit wholesaler from which third parties can get access to durable, affordable credit.
4. Start earning interest on the stablecoin supply with short-term treasuries and other low-risk strategies.
5. A focus on enabling the DAO to hire and retain talent via initiatives such as conference and hackathon sponsorships.

### Long-Term Objectives

1. Grow the interest-bearing DAI supply such that we can re-activate the Dai Savings Rate.
2. Marketing DAI as the sustainable stablecoin that gives you an implicit savings rate.
3. Fly-wheel growth via higher DSR -> More DAI Demand -> More Capacity for Loans -> Sustain the DSR.

### Anticipated Spends: Fundraising Roadshow & Promotion

* Conference sponsorship to get speaker access. This will allow us to deliver keynotes, guide hackathons, etc. This will help us both on the hiring as well as the partnership front.
* DAO-wide offsite in late summer with training sessions from core units, talks, activities in an effort to align the DAO on long term objectives. This will foster trust and community within the DAO.
* Any other ad-hoc expense that is useful and cannot be covered by the scope of individual core units.

Please note the associated fund is a request for delegated authority to spend in a discretionary way to help meet the objectives of the Task Force. It’s entirely possible this fund goes unused, but it is our preference to have it available and not use it rather than being unable to execute on something due to governance overhead.
