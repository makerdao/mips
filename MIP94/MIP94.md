## Sentence Summary

This MIP proposes that people who passively and permanently lock Dai in the Dai contract have the ability to get their funds back.

## Paragraph Summary

TBD

## Component Summary

TBD

## Motivation

Many people, such as me, have lost money on DAI because it was transferred to the DAI contract address by mistake --- which means it was permanently destroyed.

The Dai contract has the function of additional issuance. The customerâ€™s Dai is transferred to the contract itself and it is destroyed, so the recovery itself is a kind of balance of funds, and the funds will neither be less nor more

## Specification / Proposal Details

- If people transfer their Dai to the contract address, and the contract address has the characteristic of being permanently non-transferable, then we regard it as permanently destroyed
- When the Dai is regarded as permanently destroyed, it will be issued to the transferor through the mint function on the smart contract
- Maker should offer some kind of support for Dai sent to the contract. Maybe with a 10% penalty to discourage abuse.
