## Specification / Proposal Details

- If people transfer their dai to the contract address, and the contract address has the characteristic of being permanently non-transferable, then we regard it as permanently destroyed

- Maker should offer some kind of support for DAI sent to the contract. Maybe with a 10% penalty to discourage abuse.
