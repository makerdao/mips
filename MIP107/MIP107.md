## 1: Scope improvement

### 1.1: The Protocol Advisory Council

The Protocol Advisory Council is a group of Ecosystem Actors that have been approved by Maker Governance to carry out advisory work related to improving the content of the Protocol Scope Artifact.

#### 1.1.1: Protocol Advisory Council Membership Management

Members of the Advisory Council are directly approved by Maker Governance through a governance poll, and must fulfill specific criteria.

##### 1.1.1.1

The Protocol Facilitators must ensure that potential Advisory Council Members can apply to be approved by Maker Governance, using an open process with clear instructions as per *1.1.1.3*.

##### 1.1.1.2

Advisory Council Members must be Ecosystem Actors that are not involved in any business, political, or other governance-related activity that could result in a conflict of interest, either directly or indirectly. They must also have relevant skills for providing professional expert input on the content that the Protocol Scope is covering.

##### 1.1.1.3

The Protocol Facilitators must periodically, when it is relevant, review the Advisory Council Applications, and if they find applications that are suitable, bring them to a vote through an MKR governance poll. When Advisory Council Applications are posted on the Maker Forum, which must follow the template as per *1.1.2.4.1A*, the Protocol Facilitators have a review period of 30 days. During this review period, the applicant must host a Community Q&A and shall answer as many questions and doubts as possible.

###### 1.1.1.3.1

The Protocol Facilitators can extend this deadline, if necessary, by 15 days, provided they posted the justification in the Maker Forum.

###### 1.1.1.3.2

Once the review period is ended, the Protocol Facilitators must publish the response to the application on the Forum, along with a description of the reasoning behind the decision. If approved, the application will continue with the Governance Process and proceed to a vote as per *1.1.1.3*.

###### 1.1.1.3.3

Upon a successful vote, the Protocol Facilitators must arrange a service contract with the Advisory Council member, which must be made public. Approved Advisory Council Members are added to *1.1.1.6.1A*.

###### 1.1.1.3.4

Approved Advisory Council members have a term of service of 18 months from the time they are approved by Maker Governance. If desired, the Advisory Council Member can submit a new application for re-election when their term has between 60 and 30 days remaining. The re-election application must also fulfill *1.1.2* requirements and will open a new review period of 30 days where the Maker Community can provide feedback. The applicant shall again host a Community Q&A and respond to as many questions and doubts as possible. If approved, the re-election application will continue with the Governance Process and proceed to a vote as per *1.1.1.3*.

##### 1.1.1.4

The Protocol Facilitators may, if they deem it necessary, trigger a vote to remove an Advisory Council Member. If an Advisory Council Member has not done any paid work for the Scope for at least 1 year, then the Protocol Engineering Facilitators can choose to remove them at will, if they deem it necessary.

##### 1.1.1.5: Protocol Advisory Council Requirements

###### 1.1.1.5.1

Protocol Advisory Council members can be individuals, groups of people, legal entities, or companies. They can be pseudonymous or known entities. Protocol Advisory Council members must be aligned with the long-term goals of MakerDAO Endgame.

###### 1.1.1.5.2

Desired competencies for members of the Protocol Advisory Council, as many of the following as possible:

1. Proven experience as a smart contract developer or software architect in web3 and DeFi. Experience in building with COSMOS SDK is a plus.

#### 1.1.2: Protocol Advisory Council Recognition

##### 1.1.2.1

In order to be eligible for the Protocol Advisory Council as per *1.1.1.3*, an Ecosystem Actor must post a recognition submission message publicly on the Maker Governance Forum.

##### 1.1.2.2

The submission message must be cryptographically signed by the Ecosystem Actor address.

##### 1.1.2.3

```

#### 1.1.3: Protocol Advisory Council Projects and Funding

The Advisory Council is paid on a project basis to do specific work that improves all or specific parts of the Scope Framework.

##### 1.1.3.1

Entities are encouraged to submit applications with the intention of enhancing a specific portion of the Scope Framework. Any entity can notice a problem in the Scope or something that can and should be improved and apply to undergo a process to suggest improvements. There are also sometimes specific pieces of advisory work listed in *1.1.3.2* that can be taken on by applicants. The Protocol Facilitators should diligently encourage participants possessing relevant areas of expertise to actively engage in this process to the fullest extent possible. Accordingly, once this MIP is successfully passed, it is imperative that the Protocol Facilitators promptly post a Request for Applicants to the forum within a period of 30 days. The Protocol Facilitators may choose to utilize a Peer-to-Peer recruiting process, which involves allocating a portion of the Protocol Advisory Council budget to incentivize ecosystem participants and community members to actively seek out applicants, providing comprehensive explanations of the process.

##### 1.1.3.2: Advisory Work for Protocol Advisory Council Members

- Provide support on bridge design in the form of an audit / second look. This advisory work should not exceed a 100,000 DAI budget.
- Provide support on NewChain design / development principals in the form of an audit / second look. This includes a second opinion on the purpose and necessity of NewChain. This advisory work should not exceed a 400,000 DAI budget.

##### 1.1.3.3

Each Quarter, if they deem it necessary, the Protocol Facilitators must solicit proposals and find one or more suitable Advisory Council Member to perform a project that will result in output that can be used to improve the Scope Artifact. This work output will be presented to the AVC Subcommittee Meetings as input for their Aligned Scope Proposals. As many AVCs as possible should be supported this way, prioritized by the Protocol Facilitators. The Protocol Facilitators must communicate in the first 15 days of a quarter if they believe no Advisory Council work is needed for that quarter.

##### 1.1.3.4

In case an ambiguous, uncertain or challenging situation arises related to the Scope Framework, the Protocol Engineering Facilitators may publicly notify the Advisory Council Members to submits proposals for projects that aim to reactively specify the language of the Scope Framework to take into account the specific situation. The Protocol Engineering Facilitators can then directly propose the change to the Scope Framework in a weekly governance poll.

##### 1.1.3.5

The Advisory Council may produce work output that is not directly compatible with the formatting of the Scope Artifact. In this case the Protocol Facilitators must either transcribe it themselves, or hire an Ecosystem Actor to perform the transcription. This role does not require pre approval by Maker Governance.

#### 1.1.4

The Protocol Facilitators may produce advisory input on the content of the Scope Artifacts themselves, as long as it is focused on improving process and governance content. They are prohibited from providing unilateral input on expert subject matter content.

#### 1.1.5

The Protocol Facilitators have a budget available to pay for Advisory Council Projects per quarter. All spending must be limited to only what is deemed necessary and with a high probability of producing clearly measurable value, and this must transparently be accounted for in a forum post at least a week before any transaction occurs. The budget is contained in *1.1.5.1B*.

##### 1.1.5.1B

¤¤¤

**Applicants should note that budgets for Advisory Councils are intentionally accommodative across the board in order to avoid having to delay by a full monthly governance cycle in unforeseen circumstances. They are not meant to be fully spent, and attempts to spend full budgets are less likely to be approved.**

The Advisory Council project budget is as follows:

**500,000 DAI available as a one-time only budget**

¤¤¤

### 1.2: Protocol Scope DAO Toolkit Integration

The Protocol Scope DAO Toolkit module must be built to give a full overview of all smart contracts, code and other technical items and parameters that are relevant to understand the security and technical architecture of the Maker Ecosystem. The Protocol Scope must continue to develop ways to integrate access to the Scope into the DAO Toolkit.

## 2: NewChain Protocol Specification, Maintenance, and Upgrades

The Protocol Facilitators and all relevant Ecosystem Actors must use their resources to support the early stages of research and development of NewChain, when relevant.

### 2.1: NewChain Bootstrapping Budget

The NewChain bootstrapping budget is available to be used on work related to the NewChain project. The NewChain bootstrapping budget is specified in *2.1.2B*, and is allocated to relevant projects through a manual governance poll and executive vote using the weekly cycle, when triggered by the Protocol Facilitators posting a message to the Maker Core forum containing the relevant information. It is a one time budget that can only be increased or renewed through the Aligned Scope Proposal process. Some of the budget is immediate and some of it relative.

#### 2.1.1

A relative budget means a budget that is only available if the Maker Protocol is generating enough income to actively burn, and the budget can then at most spend a smaller amount of what’s being burned, ensuring that the burn continues.

#### 2.1.2B

¤¤¤

The NewChain bootstrapping budget is:
- 1,000,000 DAI immediate budget available for use through the manual process using the Weekly Governance Cycle
- 9,000,000 DAI relative budget that only becomes available as DAI is being burned in the Smart Burn Engine. The conditions are: At least 20 million DAI must have been sent to the Smart Burn Engine before the relative budget begins to unlock. Once the minimum requirement has been met, the relative budget unlocks at a rate equivalent to 25% of the DAI that is sent to the Smart Burn Engine. This means that the full 9,000,000 DAI will be available once 36,000,000 DAI above the minimum requirement has been transferred to the Smart Burn Engine.

¤¤¤

## 3: NewChain Native Governance and Neural Tokenomics

The Protocol Facilitators and all relevant Ecosystem Actors must use their resources to support the early stages of research and development of the Native Governance and Neural Tokenomics modules of NewChain, when relevant.

## 4: Two-stage Bridge

The Protocol Facilitators and all relevant Ecosystem Actors must use their resources to support the early stages of research and development of the Two-stage bridge system, when relevant.

### 4.1: Multichain Engineering Budget

The Multichain Engineering budget is specified in *4.1.1B*. It is implemented as a DssVest stream that is controlled by the Protocol Facilitators, and paid out to Ecosystem Actors in order to do work necessary for Multichain Engineering to function properly. The Multichain engineering budget should eventually be replaced by a permanent budget. Prior to the launch of NewChain, the multichain engineering budget can be used for limited bootstrapping purposes of other technologies in addition to the Two-Stage Bridge.

#### 4.1.1B

¤¤¤

The current Multichain Engineering budget is:
- 2,300,000 DAI per year implemented through DssVest streaming linearly, expiring May 2024.

¤¤¤

## 5: Developer Tools and Support

The Protocol Facilitators and all relevant Ecosystem Actors must use their resources to support the early stages of research and development of Developer tools and support, when relevant.

## 6: NewChain Halt

The Protocol Facilitators and all relevant Ecosystem Actors must use their resources to support the early stages of research and development of NewChain halt and restart procedures, when relevant.

## 7: SubDAO Frontend Client Diversity

The Protocol Facilitators and all relevant Ecosystem Actors must use their resources to support the early stages of research and development of NewChain client diversity, when relevant.

## 8: The Dai Stablecoin

The Protocol Facilitators must ensure that no development of Dai or NewStable occurs that is misaligned with the permissionlessness and unseizability requirements specified in *ATL4.8*. When NewStable is launched, it must be possible to wrap from Dai to NewStable 1:1 in unlimited amounts.

### 8.1: Stablecoin Recovery

#### 8.1.1

The strategy for returns should be based upon these factors:

- The minimum amount of DAI/NewStable to be eligible is 1000. This is a spam protection and would help to make the solution long-term cost efficient.
- A 7.5% fee for a successful return. This fee goes towards the technical development and to compensate MakerDAO for user mistakes.
- Returns should be carried out at the beginning of each quarter.
- Protocol Facilitators should determine a list of contracts and addresses that are eligibile for stuck DAI/NewStable return requests. Additions to this list can require a governance poll (tbd).
- Claimed DAI/NewStable will only be returned to the address where the transaction originated.

## 9: Scope Bootstrapping

Before the launch of NewChain, some Articles have been modified to override their Atlas requirements, and additional Articles have been added.

Before the launch of NewChain, the key concerns that these articles cover must be taken over by other parts of the Scope Artifacts.

## 10: Ethereum Core Protocol Development

Before the launch of NewChain, the Ethereum Core Protocol must be developed to support bootstrapping efforts. Facilitators and the relevant Ecosystem Actors must work together to develop, launch and maintain these

### 10.1: Ethereum Core Protocol Features

A number of Ethereum Core Protocol features must be developed and launch as a prerequisite to the development of NewChain. The different features must be developed to coordinate around multiple launch phases. After the delivery of Launch Phase 3, all resources must be focused on the complete launch of NewChain which marks the end of the bootstrapping period and the beginning of the Endgame State.

#### 10.1.1

##### 10.1.3.2

6 farms that enable users to farm 80 million NewGovToken per year with each SubDAO token.

## 11: Governance Security Engineering Work

Governance Security Engineering work includes development and deployment of spells in a secure manner.

* Writing Spells
* Developer checklists for governance security handover
* Writing Governance Security rulesets
* Developing other related materials

### 11.1: Governance Security Engineering Budget

The Governance Security Engineering budget is specified in *11.1.1B*. It is implemented as a DssVest stream that is controlled by the Protocol Engineering Facilitators, and paid out to Ecosystem Actors in order to do work necessary for Governance Security Engineering to function properly. The Governance Security engineering budget should eventually be replaced by a permanent budget.

#### 11.1.1B

¤¤¤

The current Governance Security Engineering budget is:
- 2,200,000 DAI per year implemented through DssVest streaming linearly, expiring May 2024.

¤¤¤
