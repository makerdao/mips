## 1: Scope improvement

### 1.1: The Protocol Advisory Council

The Protocol Advisory Council is a group of Ecosystem Actors that have been approved by Maker Governance to carry out advisory work related to improving the content of the Protocol Scope Artifact.

#### 1.1.1: Protocol Advisory Council membership management

Members of the Advisory Council are directly approved by Maker Governance through a governance poll, and must fulfill specific criteria.

##### 1.1.1.1: The Protocol Facilitators must ensure that potential Advisory Council Members can apply to be approved by Maker Governance, using an open process with clear instructions.

##### 1.1.1.2: Advisory Council Members must be Ecosystem Actors that are not involved in any business activity that could result in a conflict of interest, either directly or indirectly. They must also have relevant skills for providing professional expert input on the content that the Protocol Scope is covering.

##### 1.1.1.3: The Protocol Facilitators must periodically, when it is relevant, review the Advisory Council Applications, and if they find applications that are suitable, bring them to a vote through an MKR governance poll. Approved Advisory Council Members are added to 10.2.3.1:.

##### 1.1.1.4: The Protocol Facilitators may, if they deem it necessary, trigger a vote to remove an Advisory Council Member. If an Advisory Council Member has not done any paid work for the Scope for at least 1 year, then the Protocol Engineering Facilitators can choose to remove them at will, if they deem it necessary.

##### 1.1.1.5: The current approved Protocol Advisory Council Members are recorded in *1.1.1.5.1A*.

###### 1.1.1.5.1A:

¤¤¤

Current list of Advisory Council Members:

* N/A

¤¤¤

#### 1.1.2: Protocol Advisory Council projects and funding

The Advisory Council is paid on a project basis to do specific work that improves all or specific parts of the Scope Framework.

##### 1.1.2.1: Each Quarter, if they deem it necessary, the Protocol Facilitators must solicit proposals and find one or more suitable Advisory Council Member to perform a project that will result in output that can be used to improve the Scope Artifact. This work output will be presented to the AVC Subcommittee Meetings as input for their Aligned Scope Proposals. As many AVCs as possible should be supported this way, prioritized by the Protocol Facilitators.

##### 1.1.2.2: In case an ambiguous, uncertain or challenging situation arises related to the Scope Framework, the Protocol Engineering Facilitators may publicly notify the Advisory Council Members to submits proposals for projects that aim to reactively specify the language of the Scope Framework to take into account the specific situation. The Protocol Engineering Facilitators can then directly propose the change to the Scope Framework in a weekly governance poll.

##### 1.1.2.3: The Advisory Council may produce work output that is not directly compatible with the formatting of the Scope Artifact. In this case the Protocol Facilitators must either transcribe it themselves, or hire an Ecosystem Actor to perform the transcription. This role does not require pre approval by Maker Governance.

#### 1.1.3: The Protocol Facilitators may produce advisory input on the content of the Scope Artifacts themselves, as long as it is focused on improving process and governance content. They are prohibited from providing unilateral input on expert subject matter content.

#### 1.1.4: The Protocol Facilitators have a budget available to pay for Advisory Council Projects per quarter. All spending must be limited to only what is deemed necessary and with a high probability of producing clearly measurable value, and this must transparently be accounted for in a forum post at least a week before any transaction occurs. The budget is contained in *1.1.4.1B*.

##### 1.1.4.1B:

¤¤¤

The Advisory Council project budget is as follows:

Quarterly Budget (DAI) Method of Distribution Maximum Limit (DAI)

0 Keg - streamed at a linear rate over 3 months 0

¤¤¤

### 1.2: Protocol Scope DAO Toolkit integration

The Protocol Scope DAO Toolkit module must be built to give a full overview of all smart contracts, code and other technical items and parameters that are relevant to understand the security and technical architecture of the Maker Ecosystem. The Protocol Scope must continue to develop ways to integrate access to the Scope into the DAO Toolkit.

## 2: NewChain protocol specification, maintenance and upgrades

The Protocol Facilitators and all relevant Ecosystem Actors must use their resources to support the early stages of research and development of NewChain, when relevant.

### 2.1: NewChain bootstrapping budget

The NewChain bootstrapping budget is available to be used on work related to the NewChain project. The NewChain bootstrapping budget is specified in *2.1.1B*, and is allocated to relevant projects through a manual governance poll and executive vote using the weekly cycle, when triggered by the Protocol Facilitators posting a message to the Maker Core forum containing the relevant information. It is a one time budget that can only be increased or renewed through the Aligned Scope Proposal process. Some of the budget is immediate and some of it relative.

#### 2.1.0: A relative budget means a budget that is only available if the Maker Protocol is generating enough income to actively burn, and the budget can then at most spend a smaller amount of what’s being burned, ensuring that the burn continues.

#### 2.1.1B:

¤¤¤

The Maker Chain bootstrapping budget is:
- 1,000,000 DAI immediate budget available for use through the manual process using the Weekly Governance Cycle
- 9,000,000 DAI relative budget that only becomes available as DAI is being burned in the Smart Burn Engine. The conditions are: At least 20 million DAI must have been sent to the Smart Burn Engine before the relative budget begins to unlock. Once the minimum requirement has been met, the relative budget unlocks at a rate equivalent to 25% of the DAI that is sent to the Smart Burn Engine. This means that the full 9,000,000 DAI will be available once 36,000,000 DAI above the minimum requirement has been transferred to the Smart Burn Engine.

¤¤¤

## 3: NewChain Native Governance and Neural Tokenomics

The Protocol Facilitators and all relevant Ecosystem Actors must use their resources to support the early stages of research and development of the Native Governance and Neural Tokenomics modules of NewChain, when relevant.

## 4: Two-stage bridge

The Protocol Facilitators and all relevant Ecosystem Actors must use their resources to support the early stages of research and development of the Two-stage bridge system, when relevant.

### 4.1: Multichain engineering budget

The Multichain Engineering budget is specified in *4.1.1B*. It is implemented as a DssVest stream that is controlled by the Protocol Facilitators, and paid out to Ecosystem Actors in order to do work necessary for Multichain Engineering to function properly. The Multichain engineering budget should eventually be replaced by a permanent budget. Prior to the launch of NewChain, the multichain engineering budget can be used for limited bootstrapping purposes of other technologies in addition to the Two-Stage Bridge.

#### 4.1.1B:

¤¤¤

The current Multichain Engineering budget is:
- 2,300,000 DAI per year implemented through a DssVest streaming linearly, expiring May 2024.

¤¤¤

## 5: Developer tools and support

The Protocol Facilitators and all relevant Ecosystem Actors must use their resources to support the early stages of research and development of Developer tools and support, when relevant.

## 6: NewChain halt

The Protocol Facilitators and all relevant Ecosystem Actors must use their resources to support the early stages of research and development of NewChain halt and restart procedures, when relevant.

## 7: SubDAO Frontend client diversity

The Protocol Facilitators and all relevant Ecosystem Actors must use their resources to support the early stages of research and development of NewChain client diversity, when relevant.

## 8: The Dai Stablecoin

The Protocol Facilitators must ensure that no development of Dai or NewStable occurs that is misaligned with the permissionlessness and unseizability requirements specified in *ATL4.8*. When NewStable is launched, it must be possible to wrap from Dai to NewStable 1:1 in unlimited amounts.

## 9: Scope Bootstrapping

Before the launch of NewChain, some Articles have been modified to override their Atlas requirements, and additional Articles have been added.

Before the launch of NewChain, the key concerns that these articles cover must be taken over by other parts of the Scope Artifacts.

## 10: Ethereum Core Protocol development

Before the launch of NewChain, the Ethereum Core Protocol must be developed to support bootstrapping efforts.

### 10.1: Ethereum Core Protocol features

A number of Ethereum Core Protocol features must be developed and launch as a prerequisite to the development of NewChain

#### 10.1.1: NewStable with a 1:1 wrap from and to Dai available.

#### 10.1.2: NewGovToken with a 1:1200 wrap from and to MKR available.

#### 10.1.3: Smart Burn Engine for NewStable/NewGovToken pair.

#### 10.1.4: Savings Rate for NewStable with referral code system.

#### 10.1.5: SubDAO mechanics for the 6 launch SubDAOs.

##### 10.1.5.1: Core SubDAO proxy.

##### 10.1.5.2: Dssvest of 4 million NewGovToken per year for the 4 AllocatorDAO proxies and 5 million NewGovToken per year for the 2 FacilitatorDAO proxies.

##### 10.1.5.3: 6 farms with a referral code system that enables users to farm the 6 SubDAO tokens with NewStable.

##### 10.1.5.4: 6 farms that enable users to farm 4 million NewGovToken per year with each SubDAO token.

#### 10.1.6: Ethereum Core Sagittarius Lockstake Engine.

## 11: Governance Security engineering work

Governance Security Engineering work includes development and deployment of spells in a secure manner.

* Writing Spells
* Developer checklists for governance security handover
* Writing Governance Security rulesets
* Developing other related materials

### 11.1: Governance Security engineering budget

The Governance Security Engineering budget is specified in *11.1.1B*. It is implemented as a DssVest stream that is controlled by the Protocol Engineering Facilitators, and paid out to Ecosystem Actors in order to do work necessary for Governance Security Engineering to function properly. The Governance Security engineering budget should eventually be replaced by a permanent budget.

#### 11.1.1B:

¤¤¤

The current Governance Security Engineering budget is:
- 2,200,000 DAI per year implemented through a DssVest streaming linearly, expiring May 2024.

¤¤¤

## 12: Ethereum Core Protocol maintenance and upgrades

Core work involves any engineering efforts that lead to smart contract additions in the Maker MCD system and/or related repos beyond spell development. Without listing all the Core contracts, summarizing the scope of this area as:

Core engineering code:

* The bulk of all 113 Maker solidity repos and associated modules
* Maintenance - rolling tasks:
  * Integrations and implementation updates
  * Keepers
  * Supporting Infrastructure updates (compilers etc)
  * Keeping on top of L1 and any EIP changes, and e.g. gas optimization opportunities

Tooling:

* On-chain automation and integration tools
* Reusable command line tools
* Developer and internal scripts and maintenance
* Inheritable testing and interface modules
* External tooling support as needed to meet core unit objectives (i.e. foundry support)

## 13: Bug Bounty Program
The Bug Bounty Program will orient its growing community of security researchers on the Immunefi bug bounty platform towards the Maker ecosystem. The program will attract whitehat hackers who find vulnerabilities and responsibly disclose them, so they are fixed before they can be exploited. Additionally, this provides an incentivized opportunity for disclosure of vulnerabilities instead of exploitation for blackhat hackers.

### 13.1: Overview
- Continuously coordinate with developers in order to identify the scope of assets as well as impacts to ensure that bugs reported are those that are valuable to the ecosystem.
- Maintain the program by incorporating additional content where needed, such as additional requirements for submissions, restrictions, and information; adding and removing scope as needed; and including various improvements from knowledge gained through the operation of the overall Immunefi platform.
- Triage all vulnerability reports and escalate as appropriate.
- Publicly report all critical vulnerabilities after all fixes have been implemented and verified in the format of a postmortem, and respond to inquiries from the community.

### 13.2: Covered Assets and Rewards

See https://immunefi.com/bounty/makerdao/

### 13.3: Rules and Eligibility

All bug bounty hunters will be bound by the [rules on Immunefi](https://immunefi.com/rules/).

Bug reports from compensated team members of any MakerDAO business units will not be eligible for a reward. Employees and team members of third-party suppliers that operate in a technical capacity and have assets covered in this bug bounty program will also not be eligible for a reward.

Bug reports from team members and third-party suppliers of businesses and organizations that are not a MakerDAO business unit but have assets considered as critical infrastructure covered under the bug bounty program are also not eligible for the bug bounty program.

### 13.4: Payment Process and Budget Request

Payment may be delayed if the announcement of a payout draws unwanted attention to the existence of a vulnerability.

All payments are paid out in DAI, assuming a full 1:1 ratio with the USD. However, if the price of DAI deviates from the USD value by more than 1%, the amount of DAI will be adjusted. There are two pathways for payment. For small payments, Immunefi Security will send the bug bounty payment from the operational wallet. For large payments, DAI will be sent directly by executive spell in accordance with the [executive vote implementation process](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1w_z5WpqxzwreCcaveB2Ye1PP5B8QAHDglzyxKHG3CHw/) with no middleman involved to hold funds. Thus, the transfer is made directly to the bug bounty hunter. If any transfer results in exhaustion of the surplus buffer, then flop auctions will recapitalize the system. Immunefi Security will decide whether to use the small or large payment process.

In order to keep the amount of executive spells to be created to a manageable level, all verified bug reports eligible for a reward in one calendar month will be bundled into one executive spell in the first week of the next calendar month. The format of the executive spell proposal will be the same with [MIP14c2](https://github.com/makerdao/mips/blob/master/MIP14/MIP14c2-Subproposal-Template.md) in order to maintain clarity and uniformity.

For bug bounty rewards over USD 1,000,000, after the first million is paid out, the remaining amount is paid out over time with up to USD 1,000,000 per consecutive month until the determined amount for payout is reached.

As its standard fee, Immunefi will charge the DAO a performance fee based on the reward paid out to the bug bounty hunter, charged on top of the reward. Per vulnerability, the first USD 5m paid out would be charged with the standard 10% fee. Any amount over USD 5m paid out will be charged with a discounted 8% fee. For example, a bug report that pays out USD 9m would have a fee of USD 5m * 10%, which would be USD 500k, added to USD 4m * 8%, which would be USD 320k, resulting in a net fee of USD 820k. Immunefi will charge no onboarding or maintenance fees. For bounties that were paid using the small payment process, Immunefi fees will be aggregated together and sent as part of the monthly payment for professional services. For bounties that were paid using the large payment process, the first payment to the bounty hunter and Immunefi will be sent in the same executive spell. In the event that the Immunefi fee is over USD 500,000, the first USD 500,000 will be paid in the same process with the bug bounty hunter and the remaining will be paid out in the next month.

### 13.5: Postmortems

All Critical and High bug reports will have a postmortem written by Immunefi to be published on the Immunefi Medium blog and distributed on its social media channels after the payout is made and the fixes finalized. Contents of the postmortem will include details about the vulnerability, the fix applied, as well as the impact should the vulnerability have been exploited.

### 13.6: Budget

Bug Bounty Program budget is specified in 13.6.1 and the budget for small payments is specified in 13.6.2. Both are implemented as [DssVest](https://github.com/makerdao/dss-vest) streams controlled by the Protocol Engineering Facilitators, and paid out to Immunefi Security. The Bug Bounty Program budget should eventually be replaced by a permanent budget.

* **13.6.1:** The current Bug Bounty Program budget is:
87,120 DAI per year implemented through a DssVest streaming linearly, expiring May 2024.

* **13.6.2:** The current Bug Bounty Program small payment budget is:
1,320,000 DAI per year implemented through a DssVest streaming linearly, expiring May 2024.
