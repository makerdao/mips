## 6s Capital’s Motivation

6s Capital, as a commercial lender, wishes to expand its lending operations and bring on new staff to cover the Clean Money Initiative and wants comfort that credit will be available for such lending activities. With a broader approved scope, 6s Capital can then focus on growing its lending operations within that scope, raising the needed institutional equity, running the operations, being in compliance with the Credit Agreements, and engaging with governance. [Crawl. Walk. Run. - Part 1](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/rwa-6s-2022-a-time-to-start-walking-part-1/12380?u=mrabino1) [Part 2](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/rwa-6s-2022-a-time-to-start-walking-part-2/12392?u=mrabino1) [Part 3](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/rwa-6s-2022-a-time-to-start-walking-part-3/12408?u=mrabino1) [Part 4](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/rwa-6s-2022-a-time-to-start-walking-part-4/12424?u=mrabino1).

With MIP72, it is 6s’ hope that other participants engage with the DAO and follow the path that 6s has set forth to also be an operating commercial lender. [We need more LendCOs.](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/calling-all-large-scale-secured-off-chain-lenders-e-g-future-competitors/7860?u=mrabino1)

What does an “Arranger” do? In summary, an arranger is a DAO-empowered role that causes real-world commerce while doing so with “checks and balances” based on a framework and scope / authorization approved by the DAO. Further, this role is one that should “rise-above” the legal nuances (leaving those for licensed experts) and focus on core implementation, construct deals, and cause commerce.

Please see the application addendum which shall be integrated into this application. [Addendum](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/addendum-for-mip72-delegated-collateral-attachment-rwa-arranger-application-6s-capital/14481?u=mrabino1)

The DAO instructs and authorizes RWA International Ltd. and Wilmington Savings Fund Society (“WSFS”), in its capacity as Trustee (the “Trustee”) of the RWA Senior Lending Trust, a Delaware Statutory Trust, as follows.

The scope of the credit relationship between 6s Capital Partners LLC, a Delaware Series Limited Liability Company (“LendCo”) and the RWA Senior Lending Trust (“Trust”) shall be expanded as follows.

First, the Trustee may in accordance with Section 1.1.h of the [existing Trust Agreement dated 29 July 2021](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/rwa-senior-lending-trust-amended-and-restated/9773?u=mrabino1) (which already authorizes and envisions the use of multiple credit agreements, from time to time) (1) authorize and establish under Delaware law additional Trust Series under the Trust Agreement, as necessary, to engage in transactions with LendCo, and (2) modify existing or enter into additional credit and security agreements per Series with LendCo within the spirit of and which must operate materially similar to the existing [Credit Agreement dated 29 July, 2021, between LendCo and the Trust](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/6s-credit-agreement-conformed/9775?u=mrabino1), as amended, less the fundamental difference of attaching and securing different types of collateral, and be governed by the scope & terms stated in the Term Sheet herein along with all applicable exhibits including transfer instructions. Unless approved by the “affirmative vote of MakerDAO”, the Trustee may not change the definition of a Material Amendment in the Trust Agreement (e.g. any amendment to an existing or future Credit Agreement). Such vote, and the communication thereof, shall be communicated exclusively via the process outlined in the sub-proposal hereinbelow.

Second, each new credit agreement must include a legal enforceability opinion (similar to the opinions issued on 29 July 2021, for the existing Trust Agreement and Credit & Security Agreements) prior to closing issued by the Trust’s counsel. The DAO instructs and requires WSFS or LendCo to place a conformed (and redacted if confidentiality is needed) version of any newly executed credit agreements (with all exhibits) and their accompanying security agreements in the public domain (e.g. via the MakerDAO forum).

The DAO will rely upon the Trustee and its counsel, to properly draft the legal documents, including necessary amendments to the existing Trust Agreement, new Trust Series supplements, new credit agreements, security agreements, opinions, and other closing documents to ensure that the collateral is properly secured and attached in favor of LendCo and by proxy the Trust in a manner commercially consistent with other similar transactions. Further, the DAO intends to contract RWA Company LLC, or another third party (e.g. North Lakes Legal) to engage a law firm to complete document review. This law firm will view the transaction as if they are representing the interests of MakerDAO. RWA Company LLC or the other third party will report feedback from this law firm to the community..

Under no circumstance shall any material term of the credit agreement such as its required reporting or covenants be changed to be less in favor of the DAO than those stated in the existing [Credit Agreement dated 29 July, 2021, between LendCo and the Trust](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/6s-credit-agreement-conformed/9775?u=mrabino1) (unless the DAO specifically authorizes it). However, if a provision is not applicable to a particular credit agreement, it may be omitted.

Finally, the Trustee is instructed to exclusively accept additional authorizations, modifications to existing authorizations, or termination of an authorization via the sub-proposal related to third-party communication outlined herein.

### RWA Senior Lending Trust - Holding US Treasuries

As the RWA Senior Lending Trust already holds USD in cash and other collateral under “downstream” agreements (e.g. Credit Agreement(s) with LendCO), the RWA Senior Lending Trust shall be authorized to invest in U.S. Treasuries of diverse maturities in addition to (or substitution of) cash. Further, the Trustee on behalf of the Trust shall select and engage with one or more [SEC-Registered Investment Advisors (“RIAs”)](https://www.sec.gov/help/foiadocsinvafoiahtm.html), which may include an affiliate of the Trustee, to buy, sell or trade such U.S. Treasuries for the Trust in accordance with an investment policy (including desired maturity / duration etc). Any RIA(s) utilized must acknowledge (and the Trustee shall enforce) that the investment policy may only be modified by the “affirmative vote of MakerDAO” via polls / executives etc. and have such application to be an RIA for the RWA Senior Lending Trust be ratified by MakerDAO pursuant to the sub-proposal listed hereinbelow.

Further, an affiliate of the Trustee may custody such U.S. Treasuries (or other future assets at the direction of the DAO) or Trustee may engage one or more Qualified Custodian(s) (as such term is defined by U.S. federal securities laws) to custody such U.S. Treasuries. The Trustee on behalf of the Trust may pay customary custody, trading, and advisory fees approved by the Trustee. As “downstream” 6s Capital Partners LLC transactions close, the RIA for the RWA Senior Lending Trust shall then be instructed to exchange those US Treasuries for US Dollars to provide the capital pursuant to the Credit Agreement(s), or the reverse as the case may be.

### Trust Sponsor (RWA International Ltd.)

While the independent directors (regulated) of RWA International Ltd. make the decisions related to its operations, an "Authorized Representative" role (aka Authorized Signatory) is being utilized in addition to execute day to day >> administrative << tasks. This role was initially filled / held by @maarten. He was selected from the [list of approved Maker Representatives](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling/QmYM7uYq?network=mainnet#poll-detail) as he had the most commercial transactional experience, went to law school and was a practicing attorney before serving in the capacity as a chief legal officer of a publicly traded company, and had significant transaction structuring experience including taking a company public in the US (thus a familiarity and respect for regulatory hurdles before they happen while working with world-class service providers).

While @maarten at this time chooses to maintain his pseudo-anonymity, he has however cleared KYC compliance for Walkers, Cayman counsel (which anyone who has engaged in the Caymans will tell you they are quite thorough) and WSFS.

An authorized representative needs to have the following skills and requirements:

* They must possess a deep understanding of the law
* They can cause Trust funds to be returned to the Vault
* Worked with world-class service providers (Corporate Directors / Trusts / etc)
* They must be approved and clear KYC at both the Cayman and WSFS levels

As the Independent Directors control and manage the Trust Sponsor (aka CayCo), they can, at their discretion, grant certain authorizations to an individual or entity. However, there is no intention for the Directors to delegate anything more than daily administrative tasks to an individual. For example, the Directors might authorize a person to sign an annual Delaware filing, sign the US tax return, engage an accounting firm, etc.) Make no mistake, the Directors are always in control of the CayCo.

Under a credit agreement, there will be activity that was not anticipated when the agreement was signed. For example, the credit agreement may state that a lien under $1,000 is not a default. Be what if the lien is $1,050. Does it make business sense to declare a default and terminate the credit agreement over $50? Probably not. To address unknowns, a credit agreement will typically provide for (1) a cure period, (2) a waiver and/or (3) an amendment. Most events can be easily and quickly cured. In this example, paying off the lien cures the default. In other cases, actions cannot be undone and must be waived if the parties wish to continue under a given credit agreement. Other events may require waivers over and over and should instead be addressed by an amendment, so the event is not a constantly recurring default (if that is the agreement for the parties). This last option requires the affirmative vote of MakerDAO.

In this context with the structure implemented, the Directors have the responsibility to make the final decision on if they grant a reasonable waiver for commercial agreements (as requested by the US Trust) that are in the best interest of the Trust. For example, a mechanics lien is a breach of a Credit Agreement (for good reason) but unlike code, life happens. Mechanics liens are common business practice in various jurisdictions to protect workers’ rights to ensure payment. Should a mechanics lien occur (which is also a breach of the end-end borrower’s loan agreement), 6s will pursue a remedy with the end borrower to ensure the borrower resolves the underlying dispute and have the lien removed.

Sometimes, a waiver should be granted when it is in the best interests of all parties involved. Scenarios like a report being two days late on one occasion or a tax filing that has been reported and is being dealt with by a borrower should not cause a liquidation event. This is common best practice, though impossible to code. Any Director as part of their legal duties must understand the legal implications of such a waiver request. Independent Directors were selected specifically as a neutral professional was and will always be needed. Because of the power Directors have with regard to the above, they must have integrity (which is to say they do the right thing when no-one is watching) and comply with the statutory legal duties of a director. Given the legal exposure for the Directors, they would have no reason to waive any defaults unless such was in the best interest of the Trust, as they have a fiduciary responsibility.

The process of influencing that decision-making of last resort is and will always be an iterative process to which the RWA International Advisory Committee (with a sub-proposal hereinbelow) is being created to provide recommendations, and MakerDAO-context where otherwise there might be a vacuum, to the Directors. While only a first step, we look forward to collaborating with the MakerDAO community / Real World Finance team / other to refine this engagement with time.

The process to add / remove / replace the members of the Advisory Committee or the Authorized Representative at RWA International Ltd. is outlined more specifically in the sub-proposals listed hereinbelow.

Based on the above and for the avoidance of any doubt, while @maarten is already in the Authorized Representative role and has already been approved and KYC verified at both the Cayman and WSFS levels, passing this MIP shall also have the effect of ratifying @maarten in the role for RWA International Ltd. as well as confirming the process in which Authorized Representatives may be replaced in the future.

In this capacity @maarten has the obligation to perform in an honorable manner and conduct himself with his interaction with RWA International Ltd. with prudent business engagement. That said, he is only authorized for specific administrative tasks (aka no decision making), which do not include granting waivers or amending the Credit Agreements. Amending a Credit Agreement has been reserved and carved-out in the Trust Agreement to explicitly require the affirmative vote of MakerDAO. Further, Reporting Agents or Established Legitimate Parties will directly interact with this Authorized Representative as an additional overlay.

6s Capital fully understands that this interaction can and should impact the debt ceiling for this facility (now and in the future) as compliance to agreements and the feedback thereof is an essential component of any engagement. Moreover, with community members and RWA Company LLC as an Observer at 6s Capital while also receiving information from the Trust Sponsor (and / or an Authorized Representative, @maarten or his replacement) the community has complete end-to-end compliance coverage / visibility.

The medium-term roadmap for this Authorized Representative role will be to add or transition to a member of the RWF team / a new Core Unit that has specific experience in this capacity, and / or a seasoned law firm that will serve in this capacity (or just remove all together), as there is no specific legal requirement to have an Authorized Representative. This role was created for convenience to handle daily administrative tasks that would otherwise be done by the Directors. An Authorized Representative must report all of its activity to the Directors. Any authority granted to an Authorized Representative may be revoked at any time for any reason by the Directors.

In addition to the Independent Directors of RWA International Ltd., the Authorized Representative of RWA International Ltd., and the Advisory Committee, a new participant will be utilized to provide additional and independent protection for the DAO - a Trust Distribution Return Actor.

As of the posting of this MIP, the current [Amended and Restated Trust Agreement](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/rwa-senior-lending-trust-amended-and-restated/9773?u=mrabino1), Section 3.1(d)(iii) grants 6s the authority to cause the Trust to distribute funds back to the Trust Sponsor. As an interim solution, a [power of attorney was executed](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/additional-representations-risks-and-mitigations-related-to-6s-capital/9590?u=mrabino1) and granted in favor of RWA Company LLC to accomplish the same (without amending the Trust Agreement). This interim solution, while effective, is being transitioned to a longer-term process as outlined in the sub-proposal below that would cause the Trust Agreement to be amended and restated to add / remove / replace with an external agreed-upon actor to be able to independently instruct the Trustee to cause funds to be returned. Until such time as an actor is selected and implemented, the [power of attorney](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/additional-representations-risks-and-mitigations-related-to-6s-capital/9590?u=mrabino1) shall remain in force. The medium-term roadmap for this role will be to add or transition to a new Core Unit that has specific experience in this capacity, a service provider, or a seasoned law firm that will serve in this capacity.

As a side-note: The entire "6s structure" would not be where we are today without the outstanding legal work done by 6s’ counsel and @maarten. 6s is where it is today because of their steadfast assistance as well as their integrity and character (specifically the quiet help that can be discussed privately).

### Covenants

Please see the existing [Credit Agreement dated 29 July, 2021, between LendCo and RWA Senior Lending Trust](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/6s-credit-agreement-conformed/9775?u=mrabino1) for the list of positive and negative covenants. For the avoidance of doubt, the terms in the Term Sheet listed herein shall govern the future financial ratio covenants.

### Currency

All transactions are planned to be denominated in US Dollars. For capital deployed in Canadian Dollars, a financial currency hedge is needed prior to closing.

### Underwriting processes and policies - Underlying Documents

[Drafts have been shared for Credit Tenant Lease finance](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/6s-capital-llc-downstream-agreements/7457?u=mrabino1). Future underwriting documents are proprietary but consistent with previously shared documents.

### IT systems

Google / Dropbox / Other internal systems

### Auditor

[Watkins Uiberall, PLLC](https://www.wucpas.com/) or other subsequent licensed public auditing firm

### Legal Counsel

6s’ Real Estate / Power - Butler Snow (https://www.butlersnow.com)

6s’ Delaware Structuring & Federal Securities Law - Delaware Counsel Group (https://delawarecounselgroup.com)

(more will be added as needed)

### Credit guidelines

See Term Sheet

### Lender/portfolio (credit) analysis

Internally managed as the portfolio is intentionally small. All originated loans must be consistent with scope and ethos of "old-school" business / value creation while maintaining a senior-secured risk profile (with an investment grade equivalent probability of loss) and incorporating macro-economic factors to determine repayment viability. Transaction construction must incorporate the borrower's ability to make interest and principal payments (or have an interest reserve account) as well as prepayment provisions based on its operations as well as any other revenue contract enhancing its ability (e.g. a triple-net commercial real-estate lease). Such counterparties may or may not be “credit-rated” by third-party rating agencies.

In addition to the above, LendCo will conduct “stress-test” analysis to determine where transactions “break” and constrain activities as such. By utilizing the DSCR (debt service coverage ratio) or requiring additional credit enhancement from the borrower (which may include securing additional equity or guarantees in excess of standard business practice), blanket liens, or liens on other assets), LendCo can maintain a senior-secured risk profile (with an investment grade equivalent probability of loss).

### Monitoring / Servicing / Reporting

Initially, internally managed as the portfolio is intentionally small. 6s plans to engage [Bellwether Enterprise](www.bwe.com), which currently services ~$37Bn, (and / or other highly qualified servicers) to ensure a robust resilient structure of receiving payments from borrowers as 6s grows.

### Origination

As outlined in our Target Portfolio Allocation above, 6s intends on a hybrid approach of bank-participations / wholesale lending / self-originating loans. In addition, 6s intends to work with our planned Fitch-rated servicer (Bellwether Enterprise, above) which also has a nationwide loan origination platform which exceeds $12Bn annually of senior secured transactions.

## Existing Credit Agreement

This authorization does not terminate the existing [Credit Agreement dated 29 July, 2021, between LendCo and RWA Senior Lending Trust](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/6s-credit-agreement-conformed/9775?u=mrabino1) for commercial real-estate credit tenant lease finance, rather if ratified, this proposal would authorize the modification or replacement of that agreement in a manner consistent with the authorization outlined herein and allow any comments or concerns from the current Real World Finance team to be collaboratively integrated.

## Existing MIP21 and Vaults or New Application

As outlined in the motivation section of the [Addendum](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/addendum-for-mip72-delegated-collateral-attachment-rwa-arranger-application-6s-capital/14481?u=mrabino1), the “hardware” is all known (the RWA Senior Lending Trust already exists, Broker/Dealer address, MIP21, and vault). For RWA001-A, they are all known. See the ([Enforceability opinions](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/additional-representations-risks-and-mitigations-related-to-6s-capital/9590/9?u=mrabino1)) and verified ([circuit test](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/rwa001-a-circuit-test-report/10600?u=mrabino1)).
