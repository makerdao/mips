## Motivation

The Endgame Plan has been discussed in the Maker Community for more than 6 months and is now going up for a vote with the Endgame Plan Approval MIP Set. The Recognized Launch MetaDAO Clusters MIP is a required part of the Endgame Plan Approval MIP Set, and it sets up the MetaDAO Clusters to begin work immediately on preparing for the Endgame Plan Launch.

## Specification / Proposal Details

### MIP83c1: Recognized Launch MetaDAO Cluster Definition

A recognized Launch MetaDAO Cluster is a formally recognized MetaDAO Cluster led by a Cluster Facilitator that is mandated to prepare an onboarding proposal (Cluster Proposal) to a future MetaDAO alongside their regular work in the Decentralized Workforce. The Cluster Proposal will go to a vote in the MetaDAOs own governance process after the Endgame Plan Launch has occurred and initial MetaDAO tokens have been distributed.

### MIP83c2: Recognized Launch MetaDAO Cluster State Overview

This Component provides the official list of clusters with their codenames, their MetaDAO Class, and their Cluster Facilitators.

The part of MIP83c2 that is modifiable by MIP83c3 begins below this line:

* Crimson (Creator): TBD
* Vermillion (Creator): TBD
* Maroon (Creator): TBD
* Magenta (Creator): TBD
* Viridian (Protector): TBD
* Spring (Protector): TBD

The part of MIP83c2 that is modifiable by MIP83c3 ends above this line.

### MIP83c3: Recognized Launch MetaDAO Cluster Amendment Process

This process component establishes the process to overwrite the state of the modifiable part of MIP83c2, making it possible to change the number of Recognized Launch MetaDAO Clusters, their names, their class, and their Cluster Facilitators.

MIP83c3 Subproposals enter the Monthly Governance Cycle. They must use the [MIP83c3 subproposal template](https://github.com/makerdao/mips/blob/master/MIP83/MIP83c3-Subproposal-Template.md).
