## Sentence Summary

This SPF requests a 30k DAI reimbursement to SF-001 for advancing legal expenses relating to legal work in the context of MIP65.

## Paragraph Summary

This SPF reimburses the Strategic Finance Core Unit (SF-001) team for advancing funds to @christiancdpetersen for the legal work he is doing on MIP65.


## Motivation

MIP65 was approved by the Maker community but has been stalled for some weeks due to the lack of work on the legal front.

@christiancdpetersen accepted to work on it, but so far funding isn't secured despite best attempts of CES. 

SF-001 has decided to advance the funds and is asking for reimbursement to pay for regular order of business.
