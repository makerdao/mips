## Sentence Summary

The purpose of this sub proposal is to allocate 50,000 DAI for the MakerDAO event in Amsterdam scheduled between April 20-24 2022.

## Motivation

### Putting MakerDAO back in the European scene
Recently MakerDAO hosted an event at the [ETH Denver conference called DAIvinity](https://twitter.com/DaIvinity). Due to its [overwhelming success](https://newsletter.banklesshq.com/p/8-things-you-missed-at-ethdenver-ab5) and response from the Maker Community we believe that it would be good to host another event during ETH Amsterdam.

### Making it a habit

In parallel to this SPF a Core Unit proposal (MIP39c2-SP3) will be put forth on the forum for feedback. EVENTS-001 has been proposed based on discussion with the Maker community to provide a permanent budget and ongoing hosting of MakerDAO events.

### Time Constraints

Due to the time constraint imposed by MakerDAO’s current governance cycle to be able to get the funding in time for  ETH Amsterdam this SPF has been created to partially fund the event. The remainder of funds will be coming directly from participating Core Units. 

## Special Purpose Fund Name

ETHAmsterdam Event SPF

## Special Purpose Fund Scope & Work Credentials

### Fund Scope
This SPF will partially cover costs for the ETH Amsterdam MakerDAO event which has been allocated a budget of 80,000 DAI.  This is based on the “minor” event sub-budget in the core unit proposal with the addition of FTE compensation.  Due to time constraints 50,000 DAI is being requested through this SPI with the balance coming directly from participating core units.  The funding breakdown gives the scope of how the funds will be used.  Funds from this SPF will be spent between March 1 2022 and May 8, 2022.
Any unused funds would be returned to the surplus buffer.

### Work Credentials

The team who organized the ETH Denver event (John Legg & Jon Perry) would return to their roles to plan and execute the ETH Amsterdam event.


## Funding Breakdown
The following is a summary of the event budget outlining how the funds will be used.
