## Sentence Summary
SPF to request 50k DAI advance for legal expenses relating to domain work in the context of greenlit bIBTA application.

## Paragraph Summary
SPF to request 50k DAI advance for legal expenses relating to domain work in the context of the greenlit bIBTA application. The domain strategy for this collateral type is to evaluate the legal ramifications of onboarding a bIBTA vault. If the legal review is favorable, technical work can continue. If the legal review is unfavorable, it follows to avoid further investment and recommend deprioritizing.


## Motivation

SPF to request 50k DAI advance for legal expenses relating to domain work in the context of the greenlit bIBTA application.

The domain strategy for this collateral type is to evaluate the legal ramifications of onboarding a bIBTA vault. If the legal review is favorable, technical work can continue. If the legal review is unfavorable, it follows to avoid further investment and recommend deprioritizing.

The specific amount is indexed on expected hourly costs for tier-1 level legal review by Latham & Watkins or similar, as well as Swiss-based lawyers recommended independently to provide in-depth understanding of specific regulatory implications.

This SPF is necessary to allow legal teams to begin work while final reimbursement details around the budget are ironed out, and thus prevent further delays. The aim will be for this SPF to come net neutral to the overall DAO budget. All excess funds unutilized by legal review will be returned to the Surplus Buffer.

    * Robustness of the regulatory framework the collateral is issued in.

* The deliverable should be a legal memo or similar summarizing key legal risks the DAO faces by onboarding a bIBTA vault.
