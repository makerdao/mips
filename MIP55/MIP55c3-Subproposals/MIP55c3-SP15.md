## Sentence Summary

This SPF requests 50,000 DAI for legal and incorporation expenses of Phoenix Labs, an R&D company focused on creating new products for MakerDAO.

## Paragraph Summary

This SPF provides the initial funding for Phoenix Labs to work on all the legal requirements that will allow us to launch [Spark Lend by April](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/announcing-phoenix-labs-and-spark-protocol/19731). This request aims to cover the expenses related to conducting legal research to determine the type of legal entity which best matches our objectives and ---after deciding on the company structure--- incorporate it in a way that allows us to fulfill all legal requirements to launch the Spark Protocol and a base front end. 

This research will be available for any team approved by the Maker Governance that wants to build a decentralized product. With this, we will help future Ecosystem Actors join Maker in implementing the Endgame Plan.

## Motivation

Phoenix Labs comes from the need to have an Ecosystem Actor working on innovative crypto products using Maker. Over the last months, we have seen other DeFi protocols launching new products, and we think itâ€™s time for Maker to build and generate synergies that help DeFi grow using Maker as the foundation.

We have been working in our spare time on the initial concept of Spark for the last six months, and it is time to launch. We decided to work with the current governance mechanisms to launch Spark Lend (MIPs and SPFs), but we want to migrate to the future Ecosystem Scope framework once it's ready. Besides the benefits for Maker by attracting new users and generating a new line of business, this is a great way to build the Endgame Plan and the future creator subDAOs.
