## Sentence Summary

This MIP will set up a Special Purpose Fund of 500k DAI to fund a set of RWA projects to be undertaken by the [Viridian Cluster](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/viridian-cluster-introduction/18332) within the 6-month period of Jan 2023 - Jun 2023.

## Paragraph Summary

This MIP sets up a SPF of 500k DAI which will fund the due diligence, completion, and ongoing management and monitoring of the following projects: [MIP65](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP65), [MIP81](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP81), [MIP88](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP88), and potentially others brought for evaluation to the community where Monetalis will act as Arranger in the next six months. It allows Maker to continue key RWA projects in the interim period until MetaDAOs can be launched and allows the Maker Community to evaluate the work of the Viridian Cluster ahead of a potential adoption of the cluster to a Protector MetaDAO. Importantly, it also allows the resources of the Viridian Cluster to work on the Protector MetaDAO implementation.

## Motivation

We, the Viridian Cluster, believe it is key in the period until MetaDAOs can be launched that Maker does not lose steam in its engagement with RWA. This SPF is intended to allow the Viridian Cluster to accomplish a set of key Maker RWA projects that we believe are important for Maker’s engagement with RWA. Also it provides essential resources necessary for implementation of the Protector MetaDAO format. In addition, we find it good people risk management to test out a potential MetaDAO Cluster before considering an adoption. This accomplishes all of these.
