## Sentence Summary

## Specification

### Motivation

I discovered the ​​crypto ecosystem a few years ago and have followed along since then as a hobbyist. Now I am excited about the opportunity to dedicate more of my time to it.

From an early age, I’ve been interested in economics. Still, after studying and working in Finance, my professional career moved into technology, as I discovered a passion for building digital products. This passion resulted in founding a company, SIDESTREAM, that is dedicated to building software products. Throughout time, my excitement for the crypto ecosystem grew tremendously. On the one hand, it combines my passions for economics and technology. On the other hand, it fits perfectly with my personal values and worldview.

At the beginning of 2021, I set myself the following goal: Find a way that allows me to dedicate more of my time and attention to the crypto ecosystem. I was very lucky to discover the SES Incubation Program. Since joining the program in June 2021, my excitement for the crypto ecosystem and the MakerDAO in particular grew further: I engaged with different community members and dived deeper into the protocol mechanics. Through that, I realized that Maker is based on a very solid foundation and a forward-looking mindset in terms of people, governance and engineering.

Now I would like to formalize my commitment to the success of MakerDAO while taking on additional responsibility and accountability. Besides, I hope our journey can serve as a role model to other existing companies that want to ​contribute to MakerDAO’s future success.
