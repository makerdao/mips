## Specification

### Motivation

I am happy that the Maker Foundation reached its goals and dissolved, making way to the creation of a real DAO with multiple core units responsible for the ecosystem. My wish is to contribute to the stability, quality, growth, and expansion of the Maker Protocol. I believe that my skills and experience---together with the years spent as a Maker Foundation team member---make me a good candidate for the TechOps Core Unit Facilitator role, where the TechOps Core Unit is serving the Protocol by keeping a secure, reliable, and transparent infrastructure.

### Facilitator Commitment

As a Facilitator, my commitment will be to keep the TechOps Core Unit running smoothly. The daily tasks may include:

- Being the Facilitator and Quality Assurance Lead for TechOps Core Unit
- Being the main contact person for TechOps Core Unit
- Support the community by providing and executing various technical tasks
- Communicating Core Unit work progress and results
- Maintaining transparency in work, tasks, and any updates done by and within the Core Unit
- Contributing to further Core Unit growth, process improvements, and staying up-to-date with the latest tech trends

The TechOps Core Unit is planning to have two Facilitators: Simon (based in Australia), covering the APAC region; and myself (based in EU), covering the EU region. This is to ensure 24/7 uninterrupted global operations coverage.
