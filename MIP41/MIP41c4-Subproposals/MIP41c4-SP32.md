## Specifications

### Motivation

As an early enthusiast and user of the Maker system I feel incredibly grateful for the opportunity to be contributing to the DAO as part of an official Core Unit. I joined the @dux-core-unit team as Product Manager in August last year—just before we spun out of SES’ incubator as our own Core Unit. [Here's a recent forum reply](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/why-are-you-passionate-about-maker/12194/11?u=0xdeniz) in which I share some insight into the motivations that keep me going every day.

In these past months I have helped the DUX team build a sprint cadence, roadmap & prioritization framework and other supporting processes to fully empower the rest of my team (skilled, senior and passionate engineers and designers) to do what they do best and remove friction where possible. Besides ‘facilitative’ work, my ambition is to continue engaging with stakeholders outside of our team (eg. other CUs, delegates, individuals in other DAOs, integration partners, etc.) in an effort to shape and execute on initiatives that seek to improve the governance UX of Maker.

I'm honoured to take on the more formal aspects of the Facilitator role since I believe it fits the work I already do and enjoy doing. I'm also glad to realize that @bainpm will be able to once again fully focus on what he enjoys most and does best—software engineering and related research.
