## Specification

### Professional background
_Write 1-2 paragraphs about your professional career past 5 years_

### Motivation

Being the a facilitator is the consequence of all the roles I have been through, from clinical Psychologist to Talent Manager in Techs and Startups.

Leading this Core Unit will also mean contributing the co-creation of how DAOs will manage talent commuunities and interact with them in a very-near future.

I'm convinced I belong to the small bunch of people that believe that Blockchain can change the whole world we are living in.

I have an extensive list of projects and future Core Units in all matters including  Training, Onboaridng, Retention and Maker's Contributor experience, among others that will born from Maker Talent. 

Currently I am restricted to recruitment but in the future I am planning to expand Maker Talent Core Unit into such areas as contributor onboarding, training, retention and more. 

This, for me, is the beginning of something much , much bigger.

### Core Unit ID

Maker Talent: MT-001

### Facilitator name and information

- Additionally it must contain the Facilitators Ethereum address used for Budget Implementation control and other authorizations. (we need this)

### Facilitator Commitment

As a facilitator, my initial plan is as follows

#### To understand hiring manger's needs 
#### Keep due diligence in the Core Unit
#### Maker sure Maker DAO has access to the best talent out there
#### Be ready for constructive criticism, include different perspectives 
#### Being transprent about stuff
#### Promote healthy relations and fairness among Core Unit Members


#### Create a Team
#### Build a Community
#### Interact through events 
#### Tokenize 


- OKRs from the Maker Talent CU involve:


- Tools to measure success:
    - ATS
    - Candidate Experience Manager
    - Feedback Surveys
    - External Audits
    - Community Management Tools
    - 


- Commitment with Transparency
    - Monthly sessions AMA
    - Open Initatives
    - Weekly Governance Audits?
    - Publication of our OKRs

    







- The Facilitator Commitment is a detailed description and plan of what the Facilitator plans to do in order to achieve success for the Core Unit. There is a lot of flexibility in what a Facilitator can write in their commitment, including organizational structure and theory, plans for the budget, hiring and infrastructure plans, etc.
- The Facilitator commitment should also contain targets and goals that can be observed by Governance, if appropriate. This helps Governance to see whether the Facilitator is living up to their expectations.
- A crucial part of the Facilitator Commitment are clear commitments to transparency. The Facilitator should commit to an effective plan that will allow Governance and other stakeholders, such as contributors contemplating doing work, to gain direct insight into what is being worked on and who are taking care of what responsibilities.
