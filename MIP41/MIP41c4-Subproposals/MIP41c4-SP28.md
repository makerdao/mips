### Professional background

The focus of my career have always been fast growing European tech startups going through series seed to A, and where the challenge was creating the Human Resources department from scratch. 

At these international and multicultural startups, the core business was always a high-tech product with a short time to market. 

This fast-speed-growing environments many times involved increasing the staff from 0 to 120 people in less than a year and managing a group of 2-3 recruiters plus externals.

Typical profiles I'm used to interview include Tech Engineers, Product Managers, Data Analysts, CTOs or Finance Advisors, among others.

Specifically during the last 5 years, I developed myself as a Freelance Tech Recruiter for the European tech startup niche. As a side job I did Career Transition Coaching and voluntered in an NGOs as a Clinical Psychologist.

By working closely with Tech people, I developed life-changing learnings like the importance of returning value or sharing knowledge to the community you belong to, the power of decentralized systems and the way Blockchain can represent a significant change in how we make decisions or rethink the economy. I have been passionately courious about Blockchain projects since 2018. Nothing indicates that I will ever stop.

### Motivation

Being the facilitator of Maker Talent is the consequence of all the roles I have been through, from clinical Psychologist and Coach to Talent Manager or Recruiter in Techs and Startups.

Leading this Core Unit will also mean contributing to the co-creation of how DAOs will manage talent pools and interact with them in a very-near future.

I feel honoured of belonging to the small bunch of people that believe that Blockchain can change the whole world we are living in.

Currently I am restricted to recruitment but **in the future I am planning to expand Maker Talent Core Unit into other areas** impacting onboarding, training, contributor experience, retention and many more.

### Facilitator Commitment

As a facilitator, a key factor to success consists of **understanding Core Unit's needs**. Hence, my first commitment is to proof that **partnering** with Maker Talent will upgrade recruitment to a high-tech, easy-to-deal and efficient experience.

Within the Core Unit, my second commitment is **due diligence** and to be always in search of continuous growth through constructive criticism, taking into account different perspectives and judgments.

My third commitment is to **guarantee a clear and transparent communication** with the DAO, promoting clearness and honesty, towards candidates, the protocol and between Core Units.

Finally, Maker Talent and myself are comited to **healthy relations and fairness among Core Units Memebers**.
