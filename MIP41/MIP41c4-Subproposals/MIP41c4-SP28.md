## Specification

### Professional background

The focus of my career have always been fast growing European tech startups going through series seed to A and where the challenge was creating the Human Resources department from scratch. 

At these international and multicultural startups the core business was always a high-tech product with a short time to market. 

This fast-speed-growing environments many times involved increasing the staff from 10 to 120 people in less than a year and managing a group of 2-3 recruiters.

Typical profiles I'm used to interview include Tech Engineers, Product Managers, Data Analysts and Finance Advisors, among others.

During the last 5 years, I developed myself as a Freelance Tech Recruiter for the European tech startup niche. As a side job I do Career Transition Coach and a few hours as a Clinical Psychologist.

By working closely with Tech people, I developed life-changing learnings like the importance of returning value to the community you belong to, the power of decentralized systems and the way Blockchain can make significant changes in how we make decisions. I have been passionately courious about blockchain since 2018. Nothing indicates that I will ever stop.

### Motivation

Being the facilitator is the consequence of all the roles I have been through, from clinical Psychologist and Coach to Talent Manager or Recruiter in Techs and Startups.

Leading this Core Unit will also mean contributing the co-creation of how DAOs will manage talent commuunities and interact with them in a very-near future.

I'm convinced I belong to the small bunch of people that believe that Blockchain can change the whole world we are living in.

Currently I am restricted to recruitment but in the future I am planning to expand Maker Talent Core Unit int areas impacting contributor onboarding, training, retention and more. 

This, for me, is the beginning of something much, much bigger.

### Core Unit ID

Maker Talent: MT-001

### Facilitator name and information

Discord: @manomad#0321
Github: @manomad 
Forum: @manomad 

- Additionally it must contain the Facilitators Ethereum address used for Budget Implementation control and other authorizations. (we need this)

### Facilitator Commitment

As a facilitator, my initial plan is as follows

#### To understand hiring manger's needs.




#### Keep due diligence in the Core Unit
#### Maker sure Maker DAO has access to the best talent out there
#### Be ready for constructive criticism, include different perspectives 
#### Being transprent about stuff
#### Promote healthy relations and fairness among Core Unit Members


    







- The Facilitator Commitment is a detailed description and plan of what the Facilitator plans to do in order to achieve success for the Core Unit. There is a lot of flexibility in what a Facilitator can write in their commitment, including organizational structure and theory, plans for the budget, hiring and infrastructure plans, etc.
- The Facilitator commitment should also contain targets and goals that can be observed by Governance, if appropriate. This helps Governance to see whether the Facilitator is living up to their expectations.
- A crucial part of the Facilitator Commitment are clear commitments to transparency. The Facilitator should commit to an effective plan that will allow Governance and other stakeholders, such as contributors contemplating doing work, to gain direct insight into what is being worked on and who are taking care of what responsibilities.
