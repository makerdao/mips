## Sentence Summary
MIP41c4-SP7 onboards Derek Flossman as Facilitator for the Smart Contracts Core Unit.

## Specification

## Motivation

I am motivated to deliver and grow a safe, secure and scalable protocol with a team that I consider to be the engine room of the Maker protocol and leaders in the DeFi space. I want to continue working with an equally enthusiastic and talented community by building an ecosystem that has the power to bring positive change to the world.

I see the role of facilitating a technical team while also managing the expectations of the community and other domain teams as a great challenge and opportunity. Over my career, the roles that I have found the most pleasure in have always involved a multitude of stakeholders and expectations - making sense of what to work on, why and how to communicate it has always been fascinating. As a result, the technical exposure offered by this role along with the intangible social aspect of Governance offers a perfect blend for the skillset that I have.
