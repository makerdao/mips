## Sentence Summary

MIP41c4-SP18 onboards Søren Peter Nielsen as Facilitator for the Dai Foundation Core Unit.

## Motivation

I have been the formal touchpoint between the Dai Foundation board and Governance. This subproposal intends to formalize this link.

I am motivated by enabling software solutions that

* Support access to financial services for everyone on equal terms
* Implement programmable money – the internet unleashed huge value by connecting producer and consumer without middlemen in most industries, but not so much for payments and financial services

I am convinced that technologies and concepts like decentralization, cloud, IoT, social, mobile, open data – and notably the Maker Protocol - can change the way we live, work and play, and I'm convinced that working with skilled, motivated people makes the difference.

I recognize that no team/unit can act as an island in our global world, and I have past experience of creating results while working with a complex ecosystem of stakeholders.

    * Work with the Community to:
        * Enable access to Maker intellectual property for the good of the protocol, as frictionless as possible, and evolve the current trademark policy as needed
        * Create awareness of the importance of passing copyright for new Maker intellectual property deliverables to Dai Foundation for safekeeping
        * Foster a good dialogue with the community around the  principles to apply for the safeguarding of the trademarks in case of forks of the protocol
    * Ensure Dai Foundation representatives are active on the Maker Forum and available as points of contact
