### Professional background

The focus of my career has always been on fast-growing European tech startups going through series seed to A, where the challenge has been creating the Human Resources department from scratch.

At these international and multicultural startups, the core business has always been a high-tech product with a short time to market.

These fast-growing environments frequently involved increasing the staff from 0 to 120 people in less than a year and managing a group of 2-3 recruiters plus externals.

I am accustomed to interviewing such type as Tech Engineers, Product Managers, Data Analysts, CTOs, Finance and Legal Advisors, among others.

Specifically during the last 5 years, I have developed myself as a Freelance Tech Recruiter for the European tech startup niche. Alongside this, I have carried out Career Transition Coaching and volunteered in an NGOs as a Clinical Psychologist.

By working closely with people from all areas of the Tech sphere, I have embarked on life-changing "learnings" like the importance of returning value or sharing knowledge with the community you belong to, the power of decentralized systems and the way the blockchain can represent a significant change in how we make decisions or even rethink the economy. I have adopted a passionate curiosity for blockchain projects since 2018. Nothing indicates that I will ever stop.

### Motivation

My position as a facilitator of Maker Talent comes about as the consequence of all the roles I have been taken on, from clinical Psychologist and Coach to Talent Manager and Recruiter in Tech Startups.

Leading this Core Unit will also mean contributing to the co-creation of how DAOs will manage talent pools and interact with them in the very-near future.

I feel honoured to belong to the small bunch of people that believe that blockchain can change the entire world we are living in.

As I have mentioned in [MIP39c2-SP28](https://github.com/makerdao/mips/blob/master/MIP39/MIP39c2-Subproposals/MIP39c2-SP28.md), I am currently limiting Maker Talent to recruitment exclusively; however, **in the future, I am planning to expand into other areas** impacting onboarding, training, contributor experience, retention, and many more.

### Facilitator Commitment

As a facilitator, a key factor to success consists of **understanding customer needs.** Hence, my first commitment is to demonstrate that partnering Maker Talent will provide a high-tech, user-friendly, and efficient experience for both Core Units and candidates.

I constantly seek continuous growth through constructive criticism, taking into account different perspectives and perceptions. Hence, within Maker Talent, my second commitment is to foster **transparency** towards colleagues, candidates, other Core Units, and the entire Community.

Both Maker Talent and I, personally, are committed to **healthy relations and fairness within our own and towards other Core Units.**
