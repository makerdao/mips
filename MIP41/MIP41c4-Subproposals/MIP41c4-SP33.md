## Specification

### Motivation

The creation of the Events Core Unit brings a new and exciting time for myself and our team.  I want to bring my extensive skills and experience to help push MakerDAO into the next phase of growth.  I believe branded events will play a key role in this growth.  The recent DAIvinity event at ETH Denver showed just how powerful a MakerDAO event can be for the DAO and Maker community. The potential for impact of these events is extremely beneficial and by working closely with other CU's we can ensure this CU plays a critical role in MakerDAO's future.  By acting as the facilitator of the Events CU I can use my experience, skills and drive to lead the team responsible for this success at DAIvinity toward our vision and mandate outline in MIP39c2-SP32.
