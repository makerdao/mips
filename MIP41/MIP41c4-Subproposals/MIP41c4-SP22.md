## Sentence Summary

MIP41c4-SP22 onboards Tim Schuppener as Facilitator for the MakerLabs Core Unit.

## Specification

### Motivation

#### Product

I joined the crypto ecosystem pretty late (winter 2017) but learned about Maker quite early as there were very few projects around. The idea of taking a loan on a collateral in a permissionless way, without a man in the middle and by that providing a pegged asset into the volatile crypto market was very appealing to me so I started following and using the product.

I believe we did a great job so far on focusing on the core without getting distracted too much. However, I think we should start running more experiments - something MakerLabs can support.

#### DAO

Coming from a software engineering perspective, the idea of open-source has been a constant theme for me. MakerDAO feels to me like an open-source project, but with skin in the game. I guess nobody already knows how DAOs will work in the long run and I really like the idea of not knowing that but finding out on my own and being part of that journey.

#### Starter, not Finisher

During my professional career I always found it most enjoyable to jump into a new topic, gather people around it, craft a plan on how to move forward and execute on it. My interest on a topic tends to drift away from it once the hard problems are solved and it moves into maintenance/harvesting mode. In the past, I just looked for the next topic to jump on and repeat.

Working for MakerLabs would allow me to stick to the stuff I like most while not having the need to move to the next company as soon as the next topic needs to be found.
