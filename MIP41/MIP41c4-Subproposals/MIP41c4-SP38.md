## Paragraph Summary

Add @psychonaut (Jpritikin Industries, Inc) as a co-Facilitator for Core Unit IS-001: Immunefi Security.

## Specification

### Motivation

I have worked as Deputy Facilitator for Immunefi Security since its inception on Dec 2021 and, during part of its incubation period under SES, two month prior (Oct and Nov 2021). I have taken charge of the accounting, written status updates, and contributed to our core unit's goals. Our current Facilitator, @travinimmunefi, continues to lead with long-term strategic planning, but is stretched thin by his many other responsibilities. Often, when Travin has scheduling conflicts, I am asked to attend the weekly Mandated Actor's meeting in his place. This MIP formalizes what is essentially already the status quo.
