## Sentence Summary

MIP41c4-SP4 onboards Nadia Alvarez as Facilitator for Core Unit GRO-001: Growth.

## Specification

### Motivation

I want the Maker Protocol to be perceived as a solution that helps companies to grow, giving them the competitive advantage to transform what they already have into something that can serve the underserved and is committed to the sustainable finance principle, with the final objective of driving Dai adoption.

That has been my motto during this last three years working for the Maker Foundation as BD for LatAm, where I passed from a scenery where no one knew what even Ethereum was to this: “Dollar Today: the acronym (DAI) that is a sensation among those who want to dollarize in the middle of currency controls.”

That was news in the most influential newspaper in Argentina. And it’s the result of the work we did with our partners, supporting them to create a product that made sense for Argentinians, and at the same time, helping them to grow and Dai growing with them.

I also realized that the products that worked in a country do not necessarily work in another country of the same region. That’s why to achieve our ultimate goal, Dai adoption; it’s vital to support our partners in creating a product or a service to solve a local problem.
