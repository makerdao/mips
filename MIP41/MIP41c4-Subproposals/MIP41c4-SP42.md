## Sentence Summary

This subproposal onboards Prototech Labs LLC as a Facilitator for the Protocol Engineering (PECU-001) Core Unit.

## Paragraph Summary

This subproposal onboards Prototech Labs LLC as a Facilitator for the Protocol Engineering (PECU-001) Core Unit. The Prototech Labs business entity will be represented on the forum as @Prototech_Labs, with official communications also coming from its representative, @Derek.

## Specification

### Motivation

The motivation for bringing about this update is to have a professional business entity and business relationship for all activities. PECU work will continue as per the team mandate and will be conducted by Prototech Labs as experts in blockchain research & development.

This formality also helps to move the team forward in terms of branding and alignment with the Endgame as PECU prepares for new scope discussions as an independent entity.

If the [MIP4c2-SP34](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/mip4c2-sp34-expand-facilitator-definition-to-allow-entities/19736) in RFC passes on which this MIP is based, and if this MIP passes, the facilitation of the PECU-Core-Unit will be handed over to Prototech Labs LLC and its representative, @Derek. If MIP4c2-SP34 does not pass, there will be an open position for PECU facilitation after a three-month handover period.

### Details

* The existing PECU multisig and stream will continue to operate and will come under the new ownership of Prototech Labs.
* To avoid any doubt, Prototech Labs does not and will not participate in any governance polling or voting. As such, approval of a vote to onboard Prototech Labs will constitute acceptance of our [terms of service](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VMpWXAGe5oT_01tEC_hkFwAL7OjRIjeg/view?usp=sharing) and our business relationship with MakerDAO.
