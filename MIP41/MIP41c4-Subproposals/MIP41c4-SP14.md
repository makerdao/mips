## Specification

## Motivation

After spending three decades in the traditional software industry, I was burnt out and bored with all aspects of working for a large or small corporation, or even the thought of starting up another company in the same industry.

My options were to retire and drink margaritas on the beach or find something fulfilling and motivating to do for the next 20 years. I know some of you are saying, why didn't you choose to drink margaritas?!? Then I bumped into crypto at a conference in 2017 and the rest is history.

I've been mesmerized with investing and finance from my very first stock option grant in 1988 and had countless personal financial projects over the years. As an example and before HFT, I analyzed real-time data feeds for equity options looking for patterns that would indicate a large price movement in a stock. I wholeheartedly believe in the evolution (or revolution) of the worldwide financial systems for the greater good of all concerned. I also believe the Maker ecosystem is one of the few with the ability to achieve the goals of financial inclusion and creating the world's first unbiased currency.

While learning and implementing highly complex and technical systems is part of my background, the value I provide in this Facilitator role is of a builder. A builder of teams. A builder of processes. A builder of people working together to accomplish a shared objective. I believe the role of Facilitator is the most important role for a Core Unit. It requires strong leadership skills, a Jack of all trades (and a master of none) mentality, and impeccable facilitation and people skills.

Rarely, if ever, the key issue in solving a problem is the technology. Effectively getting work done in any organization requires an approach that optimizes the relationships between people, process & technology. In exactly that order!

In my opinion, the greatest work to be done is building the supply side of the equation. That is our mission and one of support and fulfillment for building the world's unbiased currency.

## Facilitator Commitment

My role is to support the Mandates and business continuity for the Collateral Engineering Services Core Unit (CES).

Today, this is best accomplished by taking the role of Facilitator, Team Lead, and Business Leader.

- Maintain visibility and transparency for all work identified, planned, and completed
