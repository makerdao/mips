As a facilitator of this Core Unit, I understand that I play a critical role in building and maintaining a healthy and productive Core Unit. I commit to the following:

1. Facilitation: I will be responsible for facilitating discussions, decision-making, and conflict resolution within the Core Unit and with the DAO. This includes creating agendas, moderating meetings, and ensuring that the stakeholders have an opportunity to participate.
2. Communication: I will maintain regular communication with the stakeholders, keeping them informed about ongoing projects, decisions, and updates.
3. Accountability: I will be accountable to Governance and act in their best interests. This includes ensuring that decisions are made transparently and fairly, and that conflicts are resolved in a timely and respectful manner.
4. Leadership: I will be a leader in the DAO and set an example for other members. This includes modeling behavior that fosters collaboration, inclusivity, and respect.
5. Time commitment: I understand that I need to commit a significant amount of time to the role, including attending regular meetings, responding to messages and emails, and staying up-to-date on relevant discussions and decisions.
