## Sentence Summary

MIP41c4-SP11 onboards Andrew Burban as the Shitpost Facilitator for the Strategic Happiness Core Unit, SH-001.

## Specification

### Motivation

Shitposting is a 24/7, random-time job, but its importance to building and maintaining a thriving community cannot be understated. It’s a lot of work, but someone has to do it! In an increasingly online world, face-to-face interactions are few and far between. Introducing that personalized touch helps remind us that we’re part of a human, welcoming community.

As the Shitpost Facilitator for the Strategic Happiness Core Unit, I will ensure that Maker’s community members are never bored and always have something to chuckle at to diffuse their pain in hard times and bond over during all times.

The Strategic Happiness Core Unit, with me as the Shitpost Facilitator, will continue to promote community engagement through humor, memes, shitposts, carefully crafted Bespoke Happiness Airdrops, and occasional appearances on stage at our forums.
