## Specification

### Motivation

Deco is led by [Vamsi Alluri](https://twitter.com/vamsiraju), principal protocol designer and smart contract programmer. Vamsi is a long time MakerDAO participant and formerly a member of the Maker Foundation Integration Engineering team as a Senior Integrations Engineer. He has assisted a large group of external partner companies to integrate with the Maker suite of products. Vamsi has been studying fixed rates in DeFi and the need for rate stability since the first signs of rate volatility within Single-Collateral Dai in 2018. He initially designed a product to provide stability to the Dai Savings Rate (DSR). Since then, he has focused on the market need of a fixed rate vault product, and as a result designed the core Deco smart contract to function seamlessly with Maker.

The purpose of the Deco core unit is to increase Maker’s competitiveness in the market, retain vault owners, attract new vault owners, and stabilize the Maker revenue stream. Vamsi has done extensive work in the past to help partners better understand risks around emergency shutdown and is motivated to reduce external dependencies and third-party protocol risk. Deco and its core unit achieve this by empowering Maker Governance, in collaboration with the existing Core Units, to effectively manage fixed rate product offerings. 

Vamsi is deeply invested in the success of both Maker and the proposed Deco Fixed Rate Core Unit as the author of the white paper, [whitepaper](https://deco.money/whitepaper), and the designer and architect of the Deco Protocol. Vamsi is the author of the [technical documentation](https://docs.deco.money/) and the Codebase repo of the base protocol implementation on [Github](https://github.com/deco-protocol/deco-base).
