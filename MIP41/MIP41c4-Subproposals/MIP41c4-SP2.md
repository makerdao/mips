## Facilitator Commitment

My main focus going forward would be:

* Please see Risk Core Unit Mandate
* Maximize Protocol self-sustainability and robustness
* Scale Risk Teams:
    * Build a independent structure of Risk analysts responsible directly to MakerDAO and compensated by the Protocol
    * Onboard additional regular contributors through mentoring and tasks
    * Make contributors specialize in Risk Domain fields i.e. monetary policy, liquidity, collateral risk assessments, auctions, risk premiums, etc.
* Simplify Rate and Debt Ceiling setting process that enables collateral type scaling
* Enhance monitoring tools for Portfolio risk (VaR and Risk Premiums) and DAI/Vault related metrics
* Address and monitor systemic DeFi risks
