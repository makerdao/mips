## Sentence Summary

## Specification

### Motivation

As MakerDAO enters a new phase were rapid scalability of the RWA pipelines that have been built up over the past year becomes possible, I believe it is crucial that the RWA Core Unit is improved and decentralized into multiple Core Units, and I believe as the oldest RWA contributor in the MakerDAO ecosystem Will Remor is the right person to take the role of Acting Facilitator and oversee the decentralization process.

### Core Unit ID

RWF-001

### Facilitator Name and Information

Name: William Remor
Discord: @will.remor#4365
ETH Address: 0x44d2509074993b858c54B6d276ebD3816FC93A68

### Facilitator Commitment

I approached Will Remor and asked if he was willing to take on the role of Acting Facilitator to oversee the decentralization of the RWA Core Units.

Will has decades of experience doing financial and credit transaction, and is the oldest contributor doing work related to RWA in the MakerDAO ecosystem, originally doing research under the Core Community Development umbrella.

The objective will be to work with various stakeholders in the Maker RWA ecosystem to develop a solid and scalable framework for RWA onboarding and then execute within this framework while decentralizing the RWA Core Units by splitting the current RWF-001 Core Unit into multiple redundant RWA Core Units that can operate in parallel. 

The framework will based on things such as the [Arranger Model](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/the-arranger-model-a-highly-scalable-rwa-framework/11298), the results of Luca Prosperi's decentralized RWA research project and the input of MKR holders.
