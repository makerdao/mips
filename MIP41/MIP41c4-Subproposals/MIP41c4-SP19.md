## Motivation

I am motivated by championing decentralized systems and alternatives to existing power structures. Maker is leading the way in this field and I am grateful for the opportunity to work with the community to contribute to the vision. As a former member of the Maker Foundation, I remember the moment when I recognized how big the governance community had grown, and how much passion and enthusiasm there was for taking on the responsibility of managing this protocol. I am inspired by watching the protocol grow and attract more like-minded people.

I am also motivated by the talented team we have at DUX, and I look forward to helping showcase the concepts and features that we want to introduce. Innovations to governance systems enabled by blockchain technology are a fertile new field, and I am excited for the opportunity to represent the team as leaders in the space.

The experiences and relationships I've had during my career at Maker have shaped me in a positive way. During times of crisis I looked to my colleagues and I saw helpers coming together to solve problems and mitigate disaster. In moments like these I have jumped into ad hoc teams without hesitation in an effort to strengthen and protect the protocol. Being a part of these teams that worked tirelessly to secure something that we all shared love for was inspiring. It solidified my commitment and dedication to supporting this community and the protocol.

I'm proud to have a role on this new team where I can make an impact by contributing my efforts towards something positive. I believe the DUX team will enhance the value of the protocol by optimizing the decision-making process, ensuring protocol security, and will bring the state of the industry forward.
