### Motivation

My passion for this space brings me back every day. I would like to take on a role where I can help ensure community members old and new have the same access and support I was afforded while furthering the goals of effective, decentralized Governance.

### Facilitator Commitment

I believe in the power and the commitment of the [GovAlpha Mandate](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/mip39c2-sp3-governance-core-unit-gov-001/6348) which I will reference throughout this section. Safety of the protocol is the primary concern for an elected member of this organization. This pledge includes, in my opinion, identifying operational mandates from a list of competing priorities. As a Governance Facilitator I commit to focusing on these principles in particular:

- Accessibility
- Neutrality
- Transparency

I believe in a balanced approach to upholding these principles while stressing the safety of the protocol is crucial to effective facilitation.

#### Accessibility

In order for any global decentralized organization to thrive, accessibility must be ruthlessly defended. Accessibility to me means:

- Opportunity to participate in communication channels regardless of identity.
- Responsive Facilitators that respond to inquires in a timely manner.
- Emphasis on "Scientific Governance" that focuses discussions on the merit of ideas.

Put plainly, **without accessibility, there is no DAO**. If platforms and communication channels are not maintained in an accessible way the community will not be decentralized.

So far, I have contributed most heavily to ensuring accessibility through writing non-technical MIPs, parameter documentation, and note-taking. I have ensured that I am an informed resource for the community and provided the community with several documents for understanding the processes and mechanisms that are adjustable through Governance.

I commit to drawing attention to proposals and encouraging healthy debate through social engagement and measured moderation. My conduct as a contributor speaks to my passion and ability to support accessibility in the MakerDAO ecosystem.

#### Neutrality

Without neutrality, this position would represent one of a gatekeeper, casting doubt on the integrity of the DAO. To me, the commitment to neutrality means:

- Showing neither support nor opposition to proposals outside the Governance realm
- Facilitating the desires and intentions of community members proposing ideas

Fundamentally, **I see my neutrality mandate as a critical component of enabling participation in Governance**. This cannot be done properly if there is a perception that I favor some proposals above others.

I have relevant experience as a Chief of Staff in Colorado's House of Representatives, where I was able to excel in constituent services by remaining reliably neutral in written and verbal communication.

Remaining credibly neutral while still being open and supportive to contributors will foster a proactive and rewarding community. I believe my spirit of positivity will further the mandate of neutrality in a manner most beneficial to the DAO.

Community members can expect me to remain deliberate in drafting copy for polls and executive votes as well as moderating in the forums. I will remain vigilant in examining my thoughts and actions for instances of bias and will endeavor to minimize its impact on the community. One way I will do this is by setting up feedback mechanisms like the [Governance and Risk Call Suggestion Box](https://app.suggestionox.com/r/GovCallQs) to hold myself accountable to the community.

#### Transparency

Transparency is an element so crucial to effective Governance that nearly every representative government the world over makes some commitment to the principle. Simply put, **sunlight remains the best disinfectant.**

So far I have represented this principle by communicating my Governance decision-making process (and any concerns from it) to @LongForWisdom. Likewise, I have leaned on the mentorship of @juanjuan, as well as the guidance and teachings of countless other community members when determining what information should be included on public posts and reports. I believe I have shown great self-awareness and emotional intelligence in these interactions.

In addition to continuing this process of self-reflection and evaluation, I will encourage groups to be more open. As a Governance Facilitator, I would consider my presence in any closed-door meetings as a proxy for the community as a whole.

#### Conclusion

If approved, I would consider it my duty to exemplify accessibility, neutrality, and transparency in every interaction within the DAO. In essence, I believe Governance will always belong to the community. If entrusted with the role of Governance Facilitator, I will give my fullest effort to continue earning the trust of the community every day and helping build a better DAO.
