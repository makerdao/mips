### Motivation

Six months ago, when I took on this role, I was motivated to do whatever it took to help launch our Core Unit and make it successful. Since that time I’ve happily watched our PM, @0xdeniz,  show his passion, enthusiasm, and commitment to Maker governance. I now feel it’s the right time to step aside and let him take on this role for the DUX team.

I know his skills and aptitudes are uniquely suited for the role of Facilitator, and the rest of the team agrees. I have fully enjoyed my time as Facilitator; it has been a great learning experience for me. I’m not leaving the team, I’ll be continuing my engineering duties as a senior developer for DUX. I’m excited to hand the Facilitator responsibilities to @0xdeniz, and I’m confident he will work hard to fulfill our mission of bringing the state of Maker governance forward!

### Core Unit ID
