## Paragraph Summary

## Specification

### Motivation

After much deliberation and based upon current events within MakerDAO and CES, I immediately terminate my role as the Collateral Engineering Services (CES) Core Unit Facilitator.

### Powers for Unwinding Plan

With my departure and per [MIP41c6](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP41#MIP41c6), I am nominating co-Interim Facilitators to assist with the offboarding of CES-001. They are:

1. Mabel Tong - @zmtong
2. David Krett - @dbkcan

Please direct all core unit inquiries to the interim facilitators.

Both facilitators are seasoned, highly-experienced professionals with the background and knowledge to continue to deliver on the CES-001 mandate and support an orderly wind down of the core unit.

The co-Interim Facilitators will retain the necessary minimum powers as listed in [MIP39c2-SP37](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/mip39c2-sp37-modifying-collateral-engineering-services-core-unit-mandate-ces-001/17751).

The relavant Core Unit unwinding plan is located within [MIP39c3](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/mip39c3-spxx-core-unit-offboarding-ces-001/18863).

### Core Unit ID

CES-001
