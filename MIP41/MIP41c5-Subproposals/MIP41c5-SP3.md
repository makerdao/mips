## Sentence Summary

This subproposal is to offboard the current Facilitator of the Content Production Core Unit (MKT-001).

## Specification

### Motivation

**Experiments** are great in every organisation. This becomes truer for web3 and truest for MakerDAO.

That being said, when an experiment is not killed on time, it becomes a money pit. Several strong reasons indicate that this is a good time to release this team from their duties:

#### Lack of Quality

This point might be hard to qualify or quantify. If anyone is astonished by the quality of this team, please let know.

Several examples of great videos can be provided if needed. World-class. The quality that Maker deserves. 

#### Lack of Speed

This team has produced two (arguably unremarkable) original videos since they started: Wormhole and How To Vote. 
The rest is just the G&R call remixed and rebranded in 7 different flavors.

The Meme Wizard has several Xs impact with a fraction of the budget.

#### Lack of Accountability and Understanding

A myriad of examples can be presented where this team has not stepped up to the occasion and offered yet another reason. Missing all the important cryptoevents is one that was mentioned in the past.

If necessary, an "anon box" can be set in place to allow others to share experiences.

#### Lack of OKRs

No transparency, no Objectives, no Key Results, nothing to evaluate this team against. This has been going for months and they haven't changed (or even acknowledged this).

Their content has no metrics attached. They aren't judging what works and what doesn't. They aren't trying new things.

#### Lack of Proactivity

They aren't reaching out to other Core Units to produce content that matters. No videos from all the features coming out from PE-001, or ORA-001, nothing from the partnerships from Growth (and most likely several are being left out: because we don't know what a good MKT team could achieve).

#### Lack of Trust

This team seems to be getting trust and support from David U (assumption: they are friends from their times together at the Foundation) and from LongForWisdom (no assumption here: as any non matter-of-factly comment will be heavily frowned upon and also they are really really nice). Have yet to find a team that relies on them.

#### Not a Social Club

These are great friendly guys, but we need to look past our friendships and seek what's best for the DAO.

#### Not a New Team

This Core Unit wasn't new to the DAO when they started their mandate. The Foundation spent thousands bootstrapping their activities and funding the different members. This means that they have had their fair share of time to get the show running, to hire the needed people, and to **start delivering results**.

### Conclusion

After over a year of what many consider a lukewarm attempt, we need to remove this team to allow for space so that other teams can grow into it. This team representing Maker is enough to discourage new talent from joining the DAO. The quality bar needs to be several feet higher.
