## Sentence Summary

MIP90 will (i) onboard and activate a DAI 600MM RWA vault for the purpose of acquiring USDC via the PSM, and (ii) approve the future purchase of USD 600MM of diversified, AAA (or equivalent) rated Structured Credit and Money Market Funds.

## Paragraph Summary

MIP90 onboards a DAI 600MM RWA vault that will acquire USDC via the PSM and acquire USD 600MM of diversified, AAA (or equivalent) rated Structured Credit and Money Market Funds. All investments will be sourced on the open market in arms-length, competitive processes through investment banks and/or broker-dealers.

At the end of every quarter, the vault will remit collected interest proceeds to MakerDAO to provide current cash flow to bolster the Surplus Buffer. Principal proceeds generated from AAA Structured Credit positions will be reinvested, until Maker governance has passed an executive vote to trigger a liquidation of the portfolio. The portfolio will maintain an opportunistic balance of short duration fixed rate Structured Credit, floating rate Structured Credit, and Money Market Funds to ensure that the collective portfolio strikes the right balance of yield generation and liquidity.

## BlockTower Credit
BlockTower Credit (“BT”) is an institutional investment fund, applying the skills of professional underwriting, structuring and investing at the intersection of real-world credit (a strong but anachronistic traditional industry) and crypto. BlockTower Credit is the credit franchise of BlockTower Capital, an SEC-registered digital asset and blockchain investment firm founded in 2017 by Ari Paul (CIO) and Matthew Goetz (CEO). The firm manages well over half a billion dollars and draws from decades of combined experience across professional investing and trading, early-stage venture capital, and credit.

BlockTower Credit principals, Kevin Miao and Jack Carlisle, have a deep history of investing in Structured Credit. Kevin ran a Structured Credit trading division as a Vice President at Citigroup, managing a ~$2bn combined book across all asset classes. Jack previously covered secondary trading in Asset Backed Securities, CLOs, Agency CMBS securities, and Legacy CDOs as a Senior Investment Analyst and Trader at Hildene Capital Management. Together with BlockTower, we bring decades worth of experience in Structured Credit markets.

### MIP90c2: Collateral Overview

For the ease of communication, the Collateral Overview section will be broken out into two independent sub sections: (1) The Structured Credit and (2) Money Market Funds.

#### MIP90c2.1: Structured Credit

The total outstanding size of the Structured Finance Market is $13.8 trillion today. Structured Credit represents the slice of the pie that sits away from government sponsored entities.

##### MIP90c2.1.1: Structured Credit - AAA Overview

Structured Credit creates the financial backbone for the consumer, residential mortgage, commercial mortgage, and sub-investment grade corporate finance industries. Unlike a Fortune 500 business, a single consumer loan or mortgage is hard to analyze and exposed to certain binary risks. A large pool of loans, however, creates diversification benefits that eliminate binary risks and allows for statistical analysis. Structured products leverage the predictability that comes with scale and create debt tranches that distill the loan pool into different risk / reward slices to meet the wants and needs of various capital market participants (banks, insurance companies, hedge funds, etc.). Simply put, Structured Credit takes raw loans with no liquidity, combines them into a vehicle with bespoke risk tranching, and creates new securities with greater liquidity than the original underlying loans. 

Each corner of Structured Credit has different nuances and loss protections tailored to effectively insulate the AAA, and other senior tranches, from potential losses. As a rule, though, cashflows generated by underlying assets are applied sequentially (paying down the most senior tranches first) and losses are borne in reverse sequential order (bottom tranches take losses first).

![](https://github.com/makerdao/mips/blob/master/MIP90/tranches.png)

For a slightly deeper dive on the allocation of cashflows, the following are key protections available for the benefit of senior tranches:

* Overcollateralization: Junior tranches provide first-loss protection for underlying credit losses.
* Excess Spread: The interest proceeds generated by loans is typically more than what is needed to pay the interest on debt tranches in a securitization. The spread between the two is used to repay principal on the AAA tranche in the event of underlying loan deterioration.
* Liquidation: If underlying performance deteriorates beyond a structure’s pre-determined loss limits, a senior tranche maintains the right to liquidate the underlying loans and sell them on the open market. Proceeds from the loan sales are used to redeem the AAA position.

Existing protections have been tested through multiple cycles and have consistently offered ample buffer to downside scenarios. CLOs, for instance, first entered the market in the 1990’s and no CLO AAA has ever taken a principal loss.

**Liquidity Profile:** AAA Structured Credit 
Roughly ~$430bn (FINRA, TRACE) Structured Credit bonds trade on the secondary market every year. The total outstanding amount of Structured Credit bonds today is roughly ~$2.9tln (SIMFA). The AAA segment of the capital structure is the most liquid part of the capital structure with a wide range of market participants (banks, insurance companies, asset managers, etc.) actively buying and selling risk. The short duration risk remote nature of AAA securities provides relative insulation from mark-to-market volatility; investors have appetite for this risk profile across different market conditions.

##### MIP90c2.1.2: Example Structured Credit Investment - CLO AAA

CLOs, short for Collateralized Loan Obligations, are Structured Credit vehicles that pool together senior secured loans issued by sub-investment grade American corporations. CLOs were first issued in 1994; there has have been over $500 billion in total issuance volume since inception. Of the total issuance to date, less than 1% of all deals have ever entered an Event of Default. A differentiating feature of CLOs is that they are actively managed vehicles. Teams of professional asset managers oversee the underlying loan portfolio and actively trade underlying loans to protect the interests of investors. 

Both underlying loans and rated AAA tranches are floating rate, which significantly limits interest rate risk and mark-to-market risk for investors. Should interest rates rise, so too does the monthly interest rate that an investor receives on his/her position. Please see [here](https://www.pinebridge.com/en/insights/clo-beyond-the-complexity) to read more about CLOs.

For an in-depth example of CLO AAA investments, see [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1cT4FnKquq_o4pWn98pVFwBbmE1q_ouHb/view?usp=sharing).

##### MIP90c2.1.3: Example Structured Credit Investment – Prime Auto ABS AAA

Prime Auto ABS securitizations pool together consumer auto loans backed by high quality, prime credit American consumers. The typical auto loan is five years in term, fully amortizing, and collateralized by an automobile. Unlike CLOs, Auto ABS deals are unmanaged and there is no option to trade underlying loans or reinvest loan proceeds upon repayment. This profile makes for short duration, fully amortizing AAA positions.

For an in-depth example of Prime Auto ABS AAA investments, see [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/13h1nPFnndP0QGRuU2T-Mj7MWhXmZ9Om2/view?usp=sharing).

#### MIP90c2.2: Money Market Funds

Money Market Funds are fixed income mutual funds that invest in short duration debt securities with minimal credit risk. Money Market Funds typically invest in a mix of US treasuries, Certificates of Deposit, Commercial Paper, Banker’s Acceptances, and Repurchase Agreements. Money Market Funds are risk remote with minimal mark-to-market volatility. Today, most Money Market funds yield between 2.5% and 3.25%.

### MIP90c3: Legal & Transactional Structure

BlockTower as an arranger has engaged seasoned and trustworthy legal counsel and Maker core contributors to understand the regulatory landscape and establish legal structure to enable and protect Maker in real-world asset transactions. We will also be leveraging lessons from our Arranger proposals and existing deals, like [MIP65: Monetalis Clydesdale](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/mip65-monetalis-clydesdale-liquid-bond-strategy-execution/13148/1) and [MIP6: Huntingdon Valley Bank](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/mip6-huntingdon-valley-bank-loan-syndication-collateral-onboarding-application/14219), in finalizing our legal structure. The exact legal structure to implement MIP90 will be determined and shared after the initial approval of this MIP.  
 
### MIP90c4: Technical & Onboarding Considerations

The technical implementation will follow specifications defined in MIP21. The smart contracts have been used in prior transactions. We will work with Collateral Engineering Services (CES-001) and the community to ensure best practices around wallet security and separation, transparency, and auditability are followed in the implementation of MIP90.
