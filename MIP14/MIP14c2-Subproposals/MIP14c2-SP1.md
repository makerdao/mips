## Specification 

### Sentence Reason

This amount will sustain the team, critical infrastructure, tools and services through the month of February. A second MIP14 subproposal will be posted for the month of March. The new budget will be voted on in March and hopefully then take over the funding from April.
    
### Reason Details

This amount is a monthly cap of TechOps CU's new revised NewBase [DAI budget](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/mip40c3-spxx-techops-core-unit-dai-budget/19017). After submitting our 2023 budget to the community it was rejected for a number of reasons, including:

- Very high budget overall --- bad time for new hires and TechOps CU failing to judge the community's sentiment for cost cutting.
- Not giving Bear market vote options --- as per MIP40 (only if the budget is higher) and as the new expected standard.
- Our role in Endgame --- transitioning to Ecosystem Actor and/or Tribunal.

We've taken this feedback onboard and have revised our new budget significantly which will be up for voting in March 2023. Due to budgeting cycle happening quarterly we're left without funding for February and March 2023.

This amount will cover our expenses for the month of February. A second MIP14 subproposal will be posted for the month of March. Any excess funds as always will be promptly returned to the protocol.

### Surplus Analysis

Proposed transfer can be taken from the current surplus.

### DAI Transfer Ceiling Analysis

The proposed transfer is within the parameters of the DAI Transfer Ceiling (250,000 DAI).

### Targets

Recipient is TechOps CU Auditor Multi-sig Wallet.
