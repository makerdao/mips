Amount: 43,560 DAI
```

## Specification 

### Sentence Reason

This amount will sustain the team and services through May by which point we anticipate dissolving as a Core Unit and becoming an EndGame ecosystem actor.
    
### Reason Details

Since 24k MKR [voted](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling/QmeYD9nA) for `Approve reduced budget - BearMarket`, we request 6,600(6 months)(1.1 contingency) = 43,560 DAI.

### Surplus Analysis

As of 02 Dec 2022, our auditor wallet contained 740,396 DAI and 0.32 ETH. Assuming that our auditor returns the balance to the protocol then the proposed transfer can be taken from the current surplus.

### DAI Transfer Ceiling Analysis

The proposed transfer is well below the DAI Transfer Ceiling (250,000 DAI).

### Targets

Recipient is the Immunefi Security CU Auditor Multi-sig Wallet.
