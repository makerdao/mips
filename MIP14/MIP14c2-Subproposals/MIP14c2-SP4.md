## Specification

### Sentence Reason

SNE-001 has delivered on its phase II milestones on budget:

* [Fast withdrawals](https://github.com/makerdao/starknet-dai-bridge): Contracts are deployed on mainnet. The front-end will be deployed within 2 weeks. We are waiting for Starkware to finalize the integration to [Starkgate](https://starkgate.starknet.io/), their bridge interface
* [Teleport](https://github.com/makerdao/starknet-dss-teleport): First versions of Starknet contracts necessary for teleport have been developed

See [Layer 2 Roadmap - History and future ](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/layer-2-roadmap-history-and-future/17310)for a broader context on teleport planning with PE-001. SNE-001 has also developed a first version of the Starknet contracts necessary for [dss-bridge](https://github.com/makerdao/starknet-dss-bridge).

SNE-001 will propose in June a joint end-game strategy with PE-001. This proposal will include an ecosystem positioning as well as an additional budget to finish teleport and the contracts required for full MCD on Starknet.

SNE-001 had funding until July 2022. However, given that the dss-teleport and dss-bridge development has taken more time than initially envisioned due to technical complexities on PECU on Starknet sides, we have decided to reduce costs to deliver the same promised deliverables within the same budget. We currently have enough funds in our CU wallet until the end of March. We are requesting a budget extension until June of 65,000 DAI.

### Reason details

We will be in a position to ask for additional budget in June.

* The current balance held in the CU wallet is: 157,000 DAI (January salaries have already been paid)
* Our typical monthly burn is: 35,000
* The forecasted spend until June is: 280,000
  * Salaries: 35,000 * 5 = 175,000 DAI
  * Audit: 50,000 DAI
  * Conferences & offsite: 15,000 DAI
  * Formal verification: 40,000 DAI

* The gap to be financed is 280,000 - 157,000 = 123,000 DAI

### Surplus Analysis

Proposed transfer can be taken from the current Surplus Buffer.
