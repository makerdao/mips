## Specification

### Context and Motivation

* As of writing, around 60% of the MakerDAO balance sheet is in stablecoin. We are often above 50% of stablecoin for the last 18 months. This provides no revenues for MakerDAO, provides bad PR and significant counterparty risk on Circle, and to a lesser extent on Paxos;
* It becomes clear that investing in DeFi Money Markets is not easy to scale (D3M rarely use more than 50M DAI);
* [Work in this direction](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/investing-our-liquidity-in-short-term-etf-managing-psms-exposures/10891) was stopped and a [potential Core Unit](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/mip39c2-sp16-adding-maker-portfolio-core-unit-mpcu-001/8996) potentially doing this job was never established.

### Declaration Detail

* MakerDAO governance wish for any party to provide a comprehensive solution to this matter;
* The whole solution should be under full control of MakerDAO governance through executive votes;
* Counterparties involved in the operations should be established and reputable companies (using metrics such as Asset under Administration and Asset under Management);
* The solution should provide a legal structure solution and all regulatory clearances backed by appropriate legal opinions from relevant reputable counsel;
* While there is no jurisdiction predefined, it is assumed that solution proposals will explain and defend their choices;
* Any investment structure can be proposed, but as guidance, the expected instruments expected are ETFs, mutual funds, a portfolio of ETF/mutual funds and/or a managed account with a narrow mandate;
* If the investment structure is done in an on-chain tokenized way, the rules above will apply to the underlying structure;
* The investment should allow for being unwound within a week under normal market circumstances (following a MakerDAO executive vote);
* The investment should, with a high degree of likelihood, be unwindable under stressed market situations within two weeks---potentially at a loss.
* Different combinations of duration and assets can be proposed, but should be within the following limits:
  * Average duration up to 2 years;
  * Investment-grade corporate and/or US Treasuries;
  * Maximum 20% of BBB-rated bonds;
  * US Dollars instruments only;
* The targeted yield to maturity of the portfolio should be 1% (2-year treasuries?) before structural costs and at least 50bps (3-month t-bills?) after all structural costs (including MakerDAO cost for monitoring);.
* The targeted size is $1B (for cost structure, investment mandate);
* The $1B allocation will be gradual;
* The evaluation criteria will be:
  * Safety
  * Cost structure
  * Flexibility
* Any investment solution selected by Maker Governance will be awarded DAI 1M to finance practical initial implementation (assuming the party is not a MakerDAO CU).
