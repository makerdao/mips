## Specification / Proposal Details

### MIP101c1: Preamble

With the Maker Constitution, Maker Governance recognizes that the fundamental value and strength of blockchain technology, cryptocurrency and decentralized finance is the ability to survive events and adversaries that would break the security of centralized systems. This has been demonstrated by technology such as Bitcoin and Ethereum which so far has proven impossible to shut down or censor. 

Unlike Bitcoin or Ethereum, the Maker Protocol requires the support of a Decentralized Autonomous Organization that operates based on direct vote by token holders. This means it relies on governance decisions by humans and institutions holding MKR tokens. Just like a smart contract can have vulnerabilities, this reliance on human input can expose weaknesses and vulnerabilities that can result in the failure of the Maker Protocol or the loss of user funds.

The Maker Constitution is a strategic tool for building as much resilience as possible into the political and operational interactions and processes that occur in Maker Governance. It is based on the same adversarial mindset that governs the design of decentralized cryptographic protocols.

The most well-understood form of governance-political vulnerability that exists in a DAO like Maker are full-scale governance attacks, such as a governance takeover or the theft of all Dai collateral. These risks are real and as a result resilience must be the first principle that all aspects of the system is designed around.

It is just as important to consider the slow moving, slippery slope governance risks, such as cultural shift, creeping misalignment or a structural inability to achieve results. These governance risks are much more likely to materialize spontaneously, and can even pave the way for full-scale governance attacks.

Budgets and decision-making around the allocation of resources, as well as control over governance privileges and prestige, are the most vulnerable parts of a DAO, as they intersect with very direct incentives of the actors involved in the governance process. Over the long term it has to be assumed that there could be attempts to exploit resource allocation by adversarial actors, or that resources will simply be wasted unintentionally. 

Robust grassroots community participation, by people who participate in alignment with the purpose of the DAO, is the essential tool to defend the protocol against these risks.

The reason that alignment with a greater purpose beyond just financial return is so important is that indifferent, misaligned participants who are motivated to take part in Maker Governance purely for the sake of financial returns, while aligned in some areas of economic gain, will have nothing stopping them from exploiting opportunities to extract value for themselves even if it comes at a cost to the broader community. 

Alignment engineering is the practice of designing mechanisms, incentives and shared habits that benefit the organizational alignment of the entire ecosystem. It is used in all organizations, but its careful use is especially important in DAOs because their decentralized nature means that the more misalignment exists, the more difficult it becomes to implement new alignment engineering measures.

The alignment engineering measures of the Maker Constitution must enforce, using specific and clear incentives and penalties, a self-sustaining equilibrium where MKR token holders can reasonably govern the DAO using a set of tools that allow Maker to grow and adapt while relying on a minimal amount of organizational alignment.

At the same time the Maker Constitution must fundamentally ensure measures that permanently reinforce a healthy growth of community alignment, by using the Maker Constitution to lock in the core commitments of the Dai Stablecoin and a public good purpose of the project that goes beyond simple financial gain.

The Maker Constitution requires clear definitions and delineations of all roles operating within the governance framework, and must strictly enforce separation of concerns. Any deliberate act that worsens conflict of interest, commingling of interest, consolidation of power or responsibility, or any other action that risks taking the DAO towards the slippery slope of governance failure is considered gross misalignment, and action must be taken to discourage such behaviour as a matter of survival.

The Maker Constitution specifies a maximally unchangeable scope of Maker Governance to the extent it is reasonable. This helps ensure transparency and reduce complexity asymmetry because the core processes and frameworks change minimally, enabling token holders to follow along. 

In all cases where it is possible, complexity, responsibility, decision-making authority and risk is pushed to the edges of the Maker Ecosystem, ensuring the core governance processes remain as simple as possible over time, reducing risk and preventing scope and mission creep.

To counterbalance the rigidity and constraint that results from the immutability inherent to the design of the Maker Constitution it implements a system for incubating and launching SubDAOs. SubDAOs are semi-independent DAOs that are linked to Maker Governance and whose core design enables a derisked, second layer of the ecosystem to foster fast-moving, unconstrained innovation, growth and experimentation. SubDAOs also enable delegation of responsibility and risk within specific, highly complex areas. In general, complexity, responsibility, decision-making authority and risk is off-loaded from Maker Core and pushed to the SubDAOs, except if the Maker Constitution specifies otherwise.

### MIP101c2: Constitutional Articles

#### 1: The purpose and values of MakerDAO

##### 1.1: The purpose of the Dai Stablecoin

The central purpose and value of MakerDAO, the Maker Protocol, the Dai Stablecoin and its community and ecosystem, is providing people access to an Unbiased World Currency in the form of the decentralized stablecoin Dai.

* **1.1.1:** Maker Governance will never allow actions that move in the direction of being able to freeze, seize or force the transfer of regular Dai tokens held in normal user accounts or fully decentralized smart contracts, either on the Ethereum network or decentralized scaling networks.

##### 1.2: Public Good Purpose

To protect the long term integrity of its governance community, Maker will always share financial success with the world through charity that is distributed broadly and with thoughtful and genuine consideration of its impact. This permanent, guaranteed, direct action is necessary to lock in the core values of Maker and the Maker Constitution forever, even in the face of community misalignment, by ensuring aligned community members are always attracted to participate Maker Governance and are willing to volunteer to deal with misalignment issues.

* **1.2.1:** To implement this in practice the Maker Constitution codifies a *Purpose System* that allocates token emissions to SubDAOs that use them on broad and diverse charitable causes chosen directly through community governance. The Purpose System is regulated through competition between the SubDAOs and checks and balances by the Ecosystem Scope Framework to ensure a lasting, verifiable and meaningful impact.
---
* **1.2.2:** Before SubDAOs and the Purpose System is ready, and to immediately a set strong example of Makers Public Good purpose that will serve as a powerful alignment artifact the Maker Constitution creates the *Public Good Fund*. Maker Governance will, through the Public Good Fund, directly allocate a large amount of MKR from the Pause Proxy MKR reserves towards charity and public good campaigns that MKR holders deem aligned with the values of the community, and that no member of the Maker Community is profiting, benefitting or being compensated from. The Public Good Fund will be managed through the Ecosystem Scope. The initial MKR reserves allocated to the Public Good Fund is 20,000 MKR. The Public Good Fund is a temporary measure and will wind down and be fully replaced by the Purpose System by 2033 at the latest.

#### 2: Dai Stablecoin Stability, Decentralization and Risk

##### 2.1: The Dai Stablecoin and Synthetic Assets

The core product of the Maker Protocol is to maintain the stability and usefulness of the Dai Stablecoin and other Syntethic Assets generated by the protocol.

* **2.1.1:** The Dai Stablecoin must have predictable stability relative to a suitable reference asset, which can be a widely adopted world currency or a diversified basket representing the cost of goods or other relevant metrics of stability and utility as a currency. 
----
* **2.1.2:** Any change to the reference asset of Dai or another Synthetic Asset by the Maker Protocol must be done to protect the value of the users and be carried out in a way that minimizes harm and maximize stability and reliability for them.

##### 2.2: Decentralization of the Dai Stablecoin

Maker must aim to use decentralized collateral to back the value of Dai to the extent it is feasible to do so while ensuring Dai stability and utility, and always ensure a high level of preparation is in place to mitigate and absorb worst case scenarios, especially legal and political risk.

##### 2.3: MKR Token Generation as Dai Backstop

The Maker Protocol will by default generate new MKR tokens and dilute the MKR supply in the event that there is a shortfall of Dai collateral that makes it unable to back up the value of the reference asset. In case of unusual, serious losses where an attempt to cover the shortfall through the generation of MKR tokens would result in the MKR token becoming worthless and consequently forcing the Maker Protocol to shut down, it is possible for Maker Governance to reject an automatic MKR generation event, and instead impose a haircut on the value of Dai. Maker Governance will always strive to prevent a Dai haircut if it is possible to do so. This is both a commitment, but also a strong game theoretical incentive because market trust in the Dai Stablecoin will be permanently damaged if a haircut ever occurs.

* **2.3.1:** Serious losses should only be possible due to real world risk, or due to governance mismanagement. By not committing to MKR dilution in scenarios where the MKR token would become worthless ("death spiralling"), it becomes possible for the Maker Protocol to safely use the MKR token as a decentralized collateral type. MKR as collateral without death spiral risk reduces exposure to Real World Asset risk while also acting as a voter incentive, reducing the likelihood of governance mismanagement.

#### 3: The Easy Governance Frontend (EGF)

##### 3.1: The Easy Governance Frontend (EGF) Definition

The EGF is the standardized and regulated application that most users will use to access MKR voter incentives. It is the central community facing feature of the Maker Constitution and is critically important for the resilience of Maker Governance. It is designed to withstand attempts by individuals to manipulate the contents or design of the EGF in order to give them an advantage in the political dynamic of Maker Governance.

##### 3.2: Design of the Easy Governance Frontend (EGF)

The EGF must be simple and gamified in order to lower the barrier of meaningful contribution enough to enable MakerDAO to benefit from the wisdom of the crowd of all the incentivized voters that receive the MKR voter incentives, and are expected to have minimal alignment.

##### 3.3: Delegation to Governance Strategies

The user experience of the EGF reduces the central governance decision MKR holders have to make down to picking a Delegate and a Governance Strategy that the delegate must vote according to. This in line with how representative democracy works by having voters choose representatives from political parties that each represent a specific political agenda.

##### 3.4: Importance of Immutability

Because the design of the EGF has an outsized impact on the outcome of Maker Governance, the design must be near-immutable and rigorously defined to ensure all attempts at manipulation will be impossible. 

#### 4: Constitutional Conservers

##### 4.1: Constitutional Conservers Definition

Constitutional Conservers are external entities that play a fundamental role in facilitating and protecting the Maker Governance process by ensuring it occurs according to the processes defined in the Maker Constitution. As such, they enable MKR holders to participate in Maker Governance in a manner where it is easy for them to make the decisions that best benefit their long term interests as MKR holders, even if the MKR holders have relatively little alignment.

##### 4.2: Roles of the Constitutional Conservers

During the Pregame, the Constitutional Conservers are able to assume 2 critical governance roles: Constitutional Voter Committee Members and Constitutional Delegates.

##### 4.3: Constitutional Conservers Eligibility Requirements

To be eligible, Constitutional Conservers must publicly pledge their unbreakable support for preserving the Maker Constitution and to fight against, and make public, all forms of corruption, organizational drift and other constitutional threats that they discover from their embedded position near the inner workings of MakerDAO.

* **4.3.1:** Constitutional Conservers may never collude or secretly organize to change the Maker Constitution or the governance dynamic of MakerDAO in general, except within the clearly delineated processes and frameworks of the Maker Constitution.
    * **4.3.1.1:** During the Pregame, the one exception to this rule is that Constitutional Voter Committe Members are allowed and encouraged to provide feedback and input on the overall direction and vision of the Final Maker Constitution.
----
* **4.3.2:** Constitutional Conservers may only be operationally active in a single Constitutional Conserver role. They may not simultaneously assume multiple Constitutional Conserver roles, or other ecosystem roles such as Ecosystem Actors.
----
* **4.3.3:** If a Constitutional Conserver is discovered to act against this pledge and the requirements outlined in **4.3** their Constitutional Conserver status is immediately derecognized. The processes for this are defined in the Arbitration Scope Framework.
  * **4.3.3.1:** In cases of mild "slippery slope" breaches, a warning may given and recorded in the Arbitration Scope Framework with no further consequence for the first breach.
  * **4.3.3.2:** In severe cases that can be described as Governance Attacks, in addition to being derecognized, the Constitutional Conserver is also stripped of all reputation under the reputation systems of the Ecosystem Scope Framework and the Physical Resilience Scope Framework.
----
* **4.3.4:** When assuming the special roles available to Constitutional Conservers, they also become subject to additional requirements specific to their role. These role-specific requirements are described in the relevant Constitutional Articles and in the Arbitration Scope Framework. Breaking these requirements also means acting against the Constitutional Conserver pledge.

#### 4.4: Constitutional Conserver Anonymity and Privacy

Constitutional Conservers are encouraged to be anonymous. After the launch of the Endgame Maker Constitution, this will become a requirement.

#### 5: Constitutional Voter Committees (CVCs)

##### 5.1: Voter Committee Definition

Voter Committees are groups of MKR holders that publicly coordinate to analyze the best voting behaviour based on a particular strategy, and publicly coordinate political positioning with other Voter Committees and voting blocs to reach compromises and middle grounds that minimize bad decisions. The base form of Voter Committees are the Permissionless Voter Committees which is a very simple designation for any kind of organized voting group.

##### 5.2: Constitutional Voter Committee (CVC) Definition

CVCs are standardized Voter Committees made up of Constitutional Conservers that participate above a minimum level in the Maker Governance process. They are subject to specific requirements, and receive various benefits, resources and support from the Ecosystem Scope.

##### 5.3: Governance Strategy Position Documents

The core task of CVCs is the consistent creation of Governance Strategy Position Documents for each of the 12 Scopes. The total collection of all latest Governance Strategy Position Documents of a CVC together form the up-to-date guidelines of the CVCs Governance Strategy, which Constitutional Delegates can follow in order to achieve Rank 1 and gain a favorable position in the EGFs.

##### 5.4: Constitutional Voter Committee Recognition Process

Permissionless Voter Committees can become recognized as CVCs by the Arbitration Scope if they fulfill the CVC eligibility requirements for participation and internal governance for at least one full quarterly governance cycle. If at any time after becoming recognized as a CVC, the CVC no longer completely fulfills all of the eligibility requirements, it immediately loses its recognition as a CVC.

* **5.4.1:** A CVC must have at least one registered CVC Member that is a Constitutional Conserver and that has publicly verified ownership of MKR, based on the process for verifying MKR as specified in the Arbitration Scope.
----
* **5.4.2:** A CVC must follow a standardized internal governance process for determining membership, creation of Governance Strategy Position Documents, and other decisions.
    * **5.4.2.1:** CVC Members vote on CVC decisions based on their relative ownership of verified MKR.
    * **5.4.2.2:** New CVC Members are included based on an application that is either accepted or rejected through a CVC decision.
    * **5.4.2.3:** Existing CVC Members can be removed through a CVC decision.
    * **5.4.2.4:** A minority quorum of CVC Members based on verified MKR can trigger a CVC split. The Arbitration Scope determines the minority quorum. All CVC Members then vote to support one of two new CVCs, with the naming rights and infrastructure inhereted by the side with more MKR in support. The CVC Members of each of the two new CVCs is determined based on who voted to support each side.
        *  **5.4.2.4.1:** During the Pregame all Governance Strategy control also transfers fully to the side with more MKR --- however this is not sustainable as it discourages the minority in an internal CVC dispute, and in the Endgame Maker Constitution must be changed to the voter strategy control splitting proportionally based on MKR amounts in support of each side.
----
* **5.4.3:** A CVC must, through a CVC decision, create a legitimate Governance Strategy Scope Position Document for each of the 12 Scopes, each quarterly governance cycle. CVCs must also convene a CVC Subcomittee Meeting to discuss the creation of the Governance Strategy Scope Position Document for each of the 12 Scopes, each quarterly cycle.

##### 5.5: Constitutional Voter Committee Support and Infrastructure

A CVC receives support and infrastructure from the Ecosystem Scope in order to make it as easy as possible to create or participate in them. The most important is access communications platforms, including forums and chatroom, and support in arranging and operating CVC Subcommittee Meetings. The infrastructure must be continuously improved to be as reliable, decentralized and privacy-preserving as possible. If necessary the Ecosystem Scope must prioritize resources towards CVCs with more verified MKR and more Governance Strategy followers.

##### 5.6: CVC Member participation rewards

CVC Members that participate in a CVC can be eligible for CVC Member participation reward that recognizes the time they are spending to support Maker Governance.

* **5.6.1:** The CVC Member participation compensation is paid out based on participation within each scope every quarter. To qualify for the participation reward for a particular Scope the CVC Member must both have attended the CVC Subcommittee Meeting and be co-author on the CVC Governance Strategy Position Document.
----
* **5.6.2:** The yearly total CVC Member participation rewards is 500 MKR. This amount is broken into tranches of 10.41 MKR for each Scope per quarterly governance cycle, and shared across the reward slots for that Scope.
----
* **5.6.3:** The MKR for the CVC Member participation rewards is taken from the protocol MKR reserve of the Pause Proxy.
----
* **5.6.4:** During the Pregame the number of rewards slots for each tranche is 14. This gives a reward of 0.725 MKR for participation in each Scope per quarter for each CVC Member that obtain reward slots.
----
* **5.6.5:** The reward slots of a tranche are awarded to the CVC Members that have fulfilled the participation requirements for the tranche and have the highest verified MKR balances.

##### 5.7: Display of CVCs in EGFs

CVCs are shown on a ranked list on the landing page of the EGFs, with name and byline displayed alongside their logo. The ranked list is determined based on highest total voter weight of the CVCs.

* **5.7.1:** Total voter weight is calculated based on total undelegated or self-delegated, verified MKR holdings of members of the CVC plus total amount of MKR delegated to delegate strategies that follow the CVC

##### 5.8: Constitutional Delegate (CD) interaction with Constitutional Voter Committee (CVC) Governance Strategies

Constitutional Delegates can inherently choose to display themselves in the EGFs as following the Governance Strategy of a CVC. When they receive votes delegated through a Governance Strategy, they must by themselves execute the strategy faithfully through active voting. Having the CDs as the implementers of the strategies protects against centralization of power in the CVCs, but also gives CDs an opportunity for abuse if they don't follow the CVCs strategy faithfully. 

* **5.8.1:** To solve the problem CVCs have the ability to ban CDs from being displayed as following their strategy, through a CVC decision. 
----
* **5.8.2:** If a CD is banned by a CVC decision, the votes delegated for the CD to the strategy will instead count as a part of the delegates independent strategy.

####  6: Constitutional Delegates (CDs)

##### 6.1: Delegates Definition

Delegates are ecosystem actors that use smart contracts which allows regular MKR holders to safely delegate their MKR voting power without having to hand over the custody of the MKR itself. The Protocol Delegation System allows those who delegate with it to use MKR as collateral to generate Dai as a Voter Incentive. Delegates are not automatically displayed in the EGFs, but can interacted with through the EGFs if the user already knows the smart contract address of the delegate Protocol Delegation System smart contract.

##### 6.2: Constitutional Delegates (CDs) Definition

CDs are Constitutional Conservers that operate Protocol Delegation System smart contracts, and receive various benefits while being subject to specific requirements in addition to the Constitutional Conserver requirements.

##### 6.3: Constitutional Delegate (CD) Income and Participation Requirements

CDs are eligible to receive significant income from the Maker Protocol if they are among the top CDs based on total votes delegated to them, and they fulfill specific participation requirements. There are two income levels for CDs: Prime Constitutional Delegates (PCDs) that receive the highest level of income, and Reserve Constitutional Delegates (RCDs) that receive a lower level of income.

* **6.3.1:** The top 7 qualified CDs by amount of delegated MKR are the PCDs. The top 8-14 qualified CDs by amount of delegated MKR are the RCDs. During the pregame, the ranks change in real time, and payouts to CDs is based on their income level at the moment the payouts occur. If a CD loses its qualification for CD income ranking, their slot goes to the next highest CD by amount of delegated MKR.
----
* **6.3.2:** Each of the PCD and RCD slots can earn up to an equal share of the total compensation available to their level each month. The actual income that gets paid out is based on how well the CDs fulfill specific participation requirements
----
* **6.3.3:** Actual CD income payouts are modified based on the requirement to have a minimum amount of participation in CVC Subcommittee Meetings. PCDs must participate in at least 16 CVC Subcommittee Meetings per month to qualify for their full share of CD income, and RCDs must participate in at least 4 CVC Subcommittee Meetings per month to qualify for their full share of CD income. If CDs participate in less than the minimum amount of CVC Subcommittee Meetings, accounted for on a weekly basis, they receive a proportionally reduced amount of the total CD income they are eligible for. If CDs participate in all the CVC Subcommittee Meetings of a month, they always receive the full amount of their CD income. Participation in CVC Subcommittee Meetings that the CDs are banned from does not count towards participation for the purposes of calculating CD income.
----
* **6.3.4:** Actual CD income payouts are also modified by voting activity metrics for the last 12 months, which includes overall voting activity in all of the votes that the CDs are able to vote on. If a CD is active in less than 95% of all votes, they receive a reduced amount of CD income. The reduction in income is proportionally linear until it reaches 0 CD income at 75% voting activity. If a CD falls below 75% voting activity, it loses qualification for CD income and any CD income rank they may be eligible for is passed on to the next highest CD by amount of delegated MKR.
----
* **6.3.5:** Actual CD income payouts are modified by CD communication metrics for the last 12 months, which requires the CDs to write an explanation for each vote that ties it to the Governance Strategy and their independent strategy, to help the MKR holders that delegated to them to understand the logic they use when executing the chosen Governance Strategies. If the CD actively communicates on less than 95% of all votes, they receive a reduced amount of CD income. The reduction in income is proportionally linear until it reaches 0 CD income at 75% communication activity. If a CD falls below 75% communication activity, it loses qualification for CD income and any CD income rank they may be eligible for is passed on to the next highest CD by amount of delegated MKR.
----
* **6.3.6:** The 7 PCD slots share a total of 2000 MKR per year amongst them, equivalent to 285.7 MKR per year for each PCD, or 23.8 MKR per month for each PCD.
----
* **6.3.7:** The 7 RCD slots share a total of 500 MKR per year amongst them, equivalent to 71.4 MKR per year for each RCD, or 5.95 MKR per month for each RCD.
----
* **6.3.8:** The MKR for the CD income is taken from the Protocol MKR reserve of the Pause Proxy.
----
* **6.3.9:** If the MKR price is below the level where PCDs receive CD income equivalent to an average full-time global upper management position, the Arbitration Scope can propose a Dai Stipend that supplements the MKR income to bring the CD income of PCDs to that level, in order to guarantee them with income security.

##### 6.4: Default Display of Constitutional Delegates (CDs) in the Easy Governance Frontend (EGF)

All CDs are displayed by default in the EGF, if they follow exactly 2 different CVC Governance Strategies. This is done by the CD having two separate Protocol Delegation System smart contracts, with each of them displaying the logo and byline of the CVC whose Governance Strategy it follows, while displaying the name of the CD. The total amount of MKR delegated to both Governance Strategies of the CD is counted for the purposes of calculating CD income level. If a CD is banned by a CVC, or the CD bans a CVC, the Arbitration Scope must ensure that MKR holders decide through a vote whether the CD is allowed to continue being displayed in the EGF with one of its Governance Strategies having transformed to an independent Governance Strategy.

##### 6.5: Constitutional Delegate Alignment Risk Mitigation

CDs are not allowed to engage directly with Ecosystem Actors and other counterparties to the DAO, or in other ways engage in operational activities. They must remain focused on providing governance information and research material to MKR holders, and acting as counterparties to the Facilitors. They are also not allowed to provide "kickbacks" from their compensation to MKR holders that delegate to them. Any violation of these requirements constitutes breaching the Constitutional Conserver pledge.

##### 6.6: Constitutional Delegate Charity

While CDs are not allowed to be involved in operational activities, or allocate their CD income towards operational activities, the one exception is using a portion of their CD income for donations to charity. It is encouraged that CDs compete and campaign on their ability to achieve some level of charitable impact with the resources available to them, in order to demonstrate alignment with the public good purpose of the DAO.

##### 6.7: Constitutional Delegate Involvement in Budget Allocation

During the Pregame, CDs can be involved directly in small scale budget allocation decisionmaking

##### 6.8: Constitutional Delegate Banning of Constitutional Voter Committee

CDs can ban CVCs if they determine that the CVC is making decisions contrary to the communicated vision, values, and byline of the CVC, and as a result is effectively disenfranchising voters who were misled as to what Governance Strategy they were delegating to. When a CD bans a CVC, it is equivalent to the CVC banning the CD, and the Governance Strategy of the CD, for the banned CVC, is transformed into an independent Governance Strategy, and the voters stop counting towards the total support of the CVC when determining its position in the EGF.

#### 7: Professional Actors

##### 7.1: Core Units during the Pregame

Core Units continue to function using the MIP framework, with MIP39, MIP40 and MIP41 still active during the Pregame. Scope Framework MIPs can empower Core Units with additional budget and responsibilities. Project based funding mechanisms, such as Special Purpose Funds can be used to provide more granular funding for specific purposes to prevent waste or unaccounted work.
 
##### 7.2: Incubation of Ecosystem Actors

Ecosystem Actor Clusters are companies or groups of companies that aren't classified as Core Units, but receive funding from project-based funding mechanisms. Their purpose is to to build out crucial market infrastructure that will be necessary for the mechanisms of the Endgame Maker Constitution to work smoothly. This includes critical services for SubDAOs, and professional and expert services for Maker Core, or b2b services for other Ecosystem Actors. Generally, two types of Ecosystem Actors exist: Advisory Ecosystem Actors and Active Ecosystem Actors.

* **7.2.1:** Advisory Ecosystem Actors are Ecosystem Actors that perform research and publish advice for the DAO to use in its governance process. Often, this is used as a check for choosing the best Active Ecosystem Actors available to supply a need defined in a Scope Framework. The work of Advisory Ecosystem Actors is implementing exclusively through modifications to the Scope Frameworks, and can also be used to receive advice regarding the specific interpretation of Scope Frameworks (which, if followed, must then be included in the Scope Framework).
----
* **7.2.3:** Active Ecosystem Actors are Ecosystem Actors that work according to the specifications of Scope Frameworks to receive funding for performing specific projects such as developing new features, performing data collection or analysis, performing marketing, growth, outreach or educational activities, legal work, government outreach, and other operational activities that benefit the Maker Ecosystem.

#### 8: Pregame SubDAO Communities

##### 8.1: Pregame SubDAO Community Definition

During the Pregame, MakerDAO will prepare the launch of 6 Launch SubDAOs to coincide with the activation of the Endgame Maker Constitution. These 6 SubDAOs will come in 3 forms: 2 FacilitatorDAOs (focused on managing governance operations of MakerDAO and other SubDAOs), 2 ProtectorDAOs (focused on interacting with real-world Assets on behalf of MakerDAO), and 2 CreatorDAOs (focused on decentralized innovation). Each of the 6 Launch SubDAOs will need well-developed Pregame SubDAO Communities, with enough community alignment to ensure the Launch SubDAOs have functional decentralized governance processes. These Pregame SubDAO Communities will be provided with infrastructure and support by the Ecosystem Scope.

##### 8.2: Pregame SubDAO Community Communication Infrastructure

The Pregame SubDAO Communities will initially have forum categories available for their use as a part of the larger Maker Ecosystem Forum that is maintained during the early stages of the Pregame by the Ecosystem Scope.

##### 8.3: Pregame SubDAO Community Moderation Rights

The Ecosystem Scope is responsible for moderating the communication channels of the Pregame SubDAO Communities. Additionally, as a part of the process of incubating independent Pregame SubDAO Communities, the Ecosystem Scope must seek to distribute moderator roles to proven active and aligned members of the Pregame SubDAO Communities. This must be done with the aim of fostering distinct communities that can keep members involved based on shared vision and values, and use moderation to ensure this core alignment isn't disrupted by unaligned actors.

#### 9: Scope Frameworks

##### 9.1: Scope Frameworks Explanation

Scope Frameworks are modifiable subcomponents of the Maker Constitution that contain highly detailed and unambiguously defined rulesets, process definitions, instructions and incentives that together cover all practical aspects of each of the key focus areas necessary for MakerDAO to function as intended and maintain resilient scalability. Scope Frameworks and the Maker Constitution are built up of nested elements which act as the basic unit of instruction and are nested within each other in hierarchy of elements including: Articles, Sections, Clauses and Subclauses.

##### 9.2: Scope Framework Coverage

Together, the Scope Frameworks cover every aspect of Maker Governance operations and there exists no Maker Governance processes or rulesets outside the definitions of the Maker Constitution and the Scope Frameworks.

##### 9.3: Scope Delineation Methodology

The Scopes are delineated to cover focus areas of high-level importance that are considered crucial for MKR holders and the general MakerDAO community to understand and verify, to prevent crucial information or processes from occuring nested within layers of complexity, which could increase the risk of community misalignment by reducing transparency and scrutiny.

##### 9.4: Modification of Scope Frameworks

Scope Frameworks are modifiable within the constraints of Constitutional Boundaries that are immutably defined in the Maker Constitution.

* **9.4.1:** Scope Framework changes must always move the Scope Framework further in the direction of decentralization, autonomous operation, future-proofing and resilience. It is not possible to reduce the level of automation implemented through a Scope Framework unless there is no other option available.
    * **9.4.1.1:** Example: It is not possible to replace a data-based algorithm that outputs a variable with a mechanism that has Maker Governance arbitrarily choose the algorithm, unless the algorithm turns out to be unworkable and no other similar replacement exists.
----
* **9.4.2:** The long term aim is that the Scope Frameworks themselves will have gone through so many thoughtful iterations that they arrive at an end state where little to no change is ever needed again, and they ultimately end up as resilient, robust and reliable as the Maker Constitution.
----
* **9.4.3:** Scope Framework changes must always reduce the complexity of rules and processes to the simplest reasonable level while also fulfilling the requirement for maximizing automation.
    * **9.4.3.1:** All elements of Scope Frameworks must routinely be examined to determine whether there is unreasonable levels of complexity that can be alleviated with modification that introduce simplification.
----
* **9.4.4:** Scope Framework changes must always increase the clarity of all rules and processes with unambiguous language, interpretative notes on intent and reasoning, and as many examples as possible, as well as recording of settled precedents and analysis of the settled precedents.
   * **9.4.4.1:** All elements of Scope Frameworks must routinely be examined to determine whether there is limited clarity that can be alleviated with modifications that increase clarity, modifications that resolve contradictions, or with interpretative notes that provide additional context.
   
##### 9.5: The 12 Scopes and Their Categorizations

There are a total of 12 Scopes defined by the Maker Constitution, and they are categorized as Primary Scopes, Supporting Scopes and Governance Scopes.

* **9.5.1:** The Primary Scopes.
    * **9.5.1.1:** Stability and Liquidity.
    * **9.5.1.2:** Decentralized Collateral.
    * **9.5.1.3:** Real-World Asset Collateral.
    * **9.5.1.4:** Ecosystem Operations.
----
* **9.5.2:** The Supporting Scopes.
    * **9.5.2.1:** Protocol Engineering.
    * **9.5.2.2:** Growth.

----
* **9.5.3:** The Governance Scopes.
    * **9.5.3.1:** Arbitration.
    * **9.5.3.2:** Governance Security.

##### 9.6: Ossification of Scope Framework Elements

Elements in Scope Frameworks within the Constitutional Boundaries cannot be freely changed by Maker Governance. A general ossification rule is applied which means that new changes must be congruent in magnitude with recent changes. This means that Elements that have not been changed for a very long time can only be modified slightly --- however, if Elements have been continuously changed in recent times, they are considered not ossified and much more significant changes can be made to them within a single cycle.

##### 9.7: Modifying the Content and Structure of Scope Frameworks

The description of each Scope Framework in the Maker Constitution outlines the general principles of the Scope, and details specific content that the Scope Frameworks must cover with elements. The general principles of the Scope and the required elements of the constitutional boundaries sections provide indirect guidance on adding additional content that are relevant to cover for the Scope Framework to function optimally as intended, as long as they fit completely within the principles of the Scope and cover a gap of functionality that is missing when considering the context. Each Scope Framework will typically be organized with an Article covering each of the sets of elements described in the list in **10**, but Maker Governance may choose to change the structure of Articles and elements in the Scope Framework, as long as the content of the required sets of elements are fully covered.

#### 9.8: Soft Scope Framework Elements

Subclauses (denoted x.x.x.x) and lower elements can be specified to be Soft Elements. Soft Elements differ from normal Scope Framework Elements in that they are not expected to harden and ossify over time, but rather always be changed, and that the process for changing them is different from the standard quarterly governance cycle based on CVC Scope Framework Position Papers. Soft Elements may also contain advanced content, including media content or interactive programs.
