## 0: Definitions

## 1: The Atlas

This MIP specifies the legacy Atlas. The legacy Atlas will soon be upgraded to Atlas v2, which is a version of the Atlas that no longer relies on the legacy MIP system, and consists of a single file that contain all Atlas Documents as a nested tree.

Before the upgrade to Atlas v2, there may be inconsistencies in the Atlas, and between Atlas and the Scopes. In case of conflicts between the Atlas and the Scopes, the Scopes takes precedence as they are generally more up to date.

Facilitators must be careful in using their judgement and common sense to ensure that all interpretations and use of their powers is in accordance with the goals of Endgame Launch: To ensure maximum growth and smooth operations and minimize governance red tape while the first Endgame Products are released, while ensuring actual, pragmatic security of the system is not jeopardized.

Document identifiers do not have to be in order or be sequential.

## 2: The Governance Scope - GOV

The Governance Scope covers rules that regulate the critical balance of power, and adjudicate on appeals processes related to misalignment in the ecosystem.

### 2.1: Scope Improvement - GOV1

The Governance Scope must have a specialized Advisory Council that is able to propose improvements to the language of the Mutable Alignment Artifact that increase Alignment Artifact Strength and increase efficiency and security of the Maker Ecosystem.

#### 2.1.1

The Governance Scope must have a customized strategy towards its display and interaction through the DAO Toolkit.

### 2.2: Atlas Immutable Alignment Artifact - GOV2

The information contained in the Atlas is the most important for determining the rules and incentives of the Maker Ecosystem, and supersedes and overrides all other competing rules or decisions. The Atlas is interpreted and used as the source of truth for determining what is Universally Aligned and what is misaligned. However, in practice it is not possible to always interpret all aspects of the Atlas directly, as the Maker Ecosystem may encounter situations that the Atlas didn’t predict. In such scenarios, it is crucial that the Atlas is interpreted in a way that is maximally Universally Aligned and prevents misalignment or slippery slope risks.

GOV2 contains the structure for Maker Governance to scrutinize and disambiguate the elements and other contents of the Atlas Immutable Alignment Artifact and define the effects and consequences in practical situations.

#### 2.2.1

The principles for when Atlas interpretation is necessary, and how it is initiated.

##### 2.2.1.1

This must cover the delineation between when Atlas interpretation can be used to cover shortfalls or gaps in the Atlas that are congruent with the spirit of the Atlas, and when interpretations are reaching too far and are going against the spirit of the Atlas and as a result, are misaligned.

#### 2.2.2

Principles and processes that must be followed when deliberating and deciding on Atlas interpretations.

#### 2.2.3

List of all settled Atlas interpretations with all necessary context.

### 2.3: Scope Bounded Mutable Alignment Artifacts - GOV3

Scope Mutable Alignment Artifacts (Scope Artifacts) are important tools in enabling Maker Governance to evolve over time while staying aligned with, and protected by, the Atlas. They specify in maximal practical and required detail how Maker Governance operates, within the constraints and boundaries set by the Atlas.

#### 2.3.1

Scope Artifacts are continuously updated. Their updates must always be aligned with the specifications of the Atlas.

#### 2.3.2

GOV3 must cover a ruleset for ossification of mutable elements, ensuring that significant changes to the Scopes take a long time and provide a lot of time for input.

#### 2.3.3: Types of Scope Elements

##### 2.3.3.1: Strengthening Elements

Strengthening Elements are regular elements that ossify over time and are meant to eventually never change as they reach a sufficient strength that the Letter of the Rules remain Universally Aligned. Every update to a Strengthening Element must make it stronger, more future proof and long term focused, and less likely to be changed in the future.

##### 2.3.3.2: Active Elements

Active Elements are mutable elements that need to change as a part of the normal operations of Governance. An example are lists of active state or parameters. The rules for changing an Active Element are codified in adjacent Strengthening Elements.

##### 2.3.3.3: Budget Elements

Budget Elements are elements that contain budgets and that can trigger valid executive votes for deploying smart contracts that can perform payments controlled by FacilitatorDAOs.

##### 2.3.3.4: Template Elements

Template Elements are elements that specify templates used for other elements. Template Elements don’t have to follow the regular Alignment Artifact formatting standards for its subelements.

#### 2.3.4

The Article must contain a process for ecosystem participants to petition for an appeal where they believe a Scope is misaligned, and the process for the Governance Scope to accept and process appeals, including fees and conditions.

#### 2.3.5

The Article must contain processes for how the outcome of appeals are recorded in Scope Artifacts

#### 2.3.6

The Article must cover specific rules related to Ecosystem Agreement appeals.

### 2.4: Alignment Conservers - GOV4

Alignment Conservers are external entities that play a fundamental role in facilitating and protecting the Maker Governance process by ensuring it occurs according to the processes defined in the Maker Core Alignment Artifact and with Universal Alignment. They enable MKR holders to have Universally Aligned participation in Maker Governance with minimal Inner Incentive, by ensuring it is very easy for MKR holders to make aligned decisions, and that there are strong protections against misalignment.

#### 2.4.1: Roles of the Alignment Conservers

Alignment Conservers can have two critical roles:

- Aligned Delegate

- Facilitator

##### 2.4.1.1

Alignment Conservers may only be operationally active in a single Alignment Conserver role. They may not simultaneously assume multiple Alignment Conserver roles, or other ecosystem roles such as Ecosystem Actors.

##### 2.4.1.2

When assuming the special roles available to Alignment Conservers, they also become subject to additional requirements specific to their role. These role-specific requirements are described in the relevant Atlas Articles and in the Governance Scope Artifact. Breaking these requirements also means breaking the Alignment Conserver requirements.

#### 2.4.2: Alignment Conservers Eligibility Requirements

Alignment Conservers must always act to preserve the spirit of the Atlas Immutable Alignment Artifact and to fight against, and make public, all forms of corruption, organizational drift and other misalignment threats that they discover from their embedded position near the inner workings of MakerDAO. They must be held to a high standard in terms of acting with Universal Alignment.

#### 2.4.3

Alignment Conservers may never collude or secretly organize to change the Alignment Artifacts or the governance dynamic of MakerDAO in general, except within the clearly delineated processes and frameworks of the Maker Core Alignment Artifact.

#### 2.4.4

If an Alignment Conserver is discovered to act against the requirements outlined in *2.4.2* and its subelements their Alignment Conserver status must immediately be derecognized by the FacilitatorDAOs. GOV4 must specify the processes for derecognition so that they are fair and minimize risk for the Maker Ecosystem.

##### 2.4.4.1

In cases of mild “slippery slope” breaches, a warning may be given and recorded in the Governance Artifact with no further consequence for the first breach.

##### 2.4.4.2

In severe cases that can be described as Governance Attacks, in addition to being derecognized, the Alignment Conserver is also stripped of all reputation recognized in reputation systems of the Scopes.

#### 2.4.5: Alignment Conserver Anonymity and Privacy

Alignment Conservers are encouraged to be anonymous. Some Alignment Conserver roles are required to be anonymous, and their identities must be derecognized from acting as Alignment Conservers in general, in case their privacy is breached.

### 2.6: Aligned Delegates (ADs) - GOV6

ADs are Alignment Conservers that have registered based on the processes specified in the Governance Scope Artifact. ADs receive various benefits while being subject to specific requirements in addition to the general Alignment Conserver requirements. ADs have significant physical power over the Maker Protocol as they control votes obtained from delegation of voting power. As a result their focus is to protect the Maker Ecosystem against abuse of this power by themselves or others, and to use the power to protect the Maker Ecosystem in case other parts of the Governance Process take misaligned actions.

#### 2.6.1: Protocol Delegation Modules (PDMs)

Protocol Delegation Modules are NewChain Modules that can be created and controlled by external smart contracts or accounts, and can receive delegated voting power from MKR holders and Lockstake Engine users.

##### 2.6.1.1

PDMs function with a season system begins on the monday of the 11th full week of the first quarter of the year, and ends on the friday of the 12th full week of the first quarter of the following year. The period where seasons overlap, from the monday of the 11th full week of the first quarter to the friday of the 12th full week of the first quarter in the same year, is called the Election Season.

##### 2.6.1.2

PDMs are Seasonally Active from the moment they are created, until the Season they were created in ends. If they are created during the Election Season, then they count as being created in the later overlapping Season. PDMs expire and lose their voting power at the end of the second season of their existence, with a total lifetime of up to approximately 2 years and 2 weeks.

##### 2.6.1.3

Delegating to Seasonally Active PDMs will qualify Lockstake Engine users for Governance Participation Rewards throughout the entire Season, until the monday of the 12th full week of the first quarter of the year for PDMs of the earlier overlapping season.

#### 2.6.3: Aligned Delegate Income and Participation Requirements

ADs are eligible to receive significant income from the Maker Protocol if they are among the top ADs based on total votes delegated to their delegation contracts, and they fulfill specific participation requirements. There are two income levels for ADs: Prime Delegates (PDs) that receive the highest level of income and have a degree of income security, and Reserve Aligned Delegates (RDs) that receive a lower level of income.

##### 2.6.3.1

The Governance Scope Artifact specifies the number of PD slots, and the number of RD slots.

###### 2.6.3.3.3

The beneficiaries of the available PD and RD slots change in real time based on the top ranking of ADs that aren’t PDs by total amount of MKR delegated to their delegation contract(s).

##### 2.6.3.4: AD Buffer

The AD Buffer is an account of NGT and NST that builds up when an AD achieves a budget rank of either PD or RD. The budget that an AD is responsible for accumulates in the AD buffer. It cannot be spent until it contains at least 1 month's worth of budget. Once monthly, all ADs can request payments from their buffers. An AD's monthly payment request can be any amount as long as there is still at least one month worth of budget remaining after the payments are made. Payments can be requested to multiple addresses at once and can include the address that controls the AD's PDM. ADs can include descriptions of what the payments are for, which can include personal compensation, compensation to team contributors, research expenses, and more. The Governance Facilitators then include the payments in the next Executive Spell. PDs must only use the full amounts of their budgets if they are contributing significant, best in class work towards the development of the Atlas, and their budget use must generally be scaled according to their level of Atlas contributions.

###### 2.6.3.4.1

If an AD loses all its income, or loses a part of its income by moving from PD to RD, the AD Buffer starts paying out the excess funds it contains so that it reaches 1 month's equivalent income after 1 month. In case the AD has no income, this means that all of the contents of the AD Buffer are paid out over the course of 1 month.

###### 2.6.3.4.2

The AD Buffer is used as collateral for a whistleblower bounty in case the AD acts misaligned or has their privacy compromised.

##### 2.6.3.5

Each of the PD and RD slots earns up to an equal share of the total compensation available to their level each month, paid out continuously in real time. The income that gets paid out can be reduced if the ADs don’t fully comply with participation requirements

##### 2.6.3.7

Actual AD income payouts are modified by voting activity metrics for the last 3 months, which includes overall voting activity in all of the votes that the ADs are able to vote on. If an AD is active in less than 95% of all votes over the last 3 months, they receive a reduced amount of AD income. The reduction in income is proportionally linear until it reaches 0 AD income at 75% voting activity. If an AD falls below 75% voting activity over the last 3 months, it loses qualification for AD income and any AD income rank they may be eligible for is passed on to the next highest AD by total amount of MKR delegated to their delegation contract. A PD can lose their PD status this way, and even if their activity metric recovers they do not automatically become a PD again, except through the regular process of becoming a PD outside of the Election Season.

##### 2.6.3.8

Actual AD income payouts are modified by AD communication metrics for the last 3 months, which requires the ADs to write an explanation for each vote that demonstrates its universal alignment. If the AD actively communicates on less than 95% of all votes over the last 3 months, they receive a reduced amount of AD income. The reduction in income is proportionally linear until it reaches 0 AD income at 75% communication activity over the last 3 months. If an AD falls below 75% communication activity over the last 3 months, it loses qualification for AD income and any AD income rank they may be eligible for is passed on to the next highest AD by total amount of MKR delegated to their delegation contract​​​​​​​. A PD can lose their PD status this way.

##### 2.6.3.9

The PD slots each have a continually accruing budget equating to 650,000 NST and 3,960,000 NGT per year.

##### 2.6.3.10

The RD slots each have a continually accruing budget equating to 100,000 NST and of 360,000 NGT per year.

#### 2.6.5: Aligned Delegate Alignment Risk Mitigation

Delegates are not allowed to provide “kickbacks” from their compensation to MKR holders that delegate to them. Any violation of these requirements constitutes breaching the Alignment Conserver requirements.

##### 2.6.5.1

If a FacilitatorDAO finds that an AD has performed a misaligned act or breached their requirements, they can derecognize the AD and confiscate their AD Buffer. The AD Buffer can be used as a whistleblower bounty in case an ecosystem actor provided useful data, information or evidence that led to the derecognition of the AD. GOV6 must specify sufficient safety mechanisms around the payment of the whistleblower bounty.

###### 2.6.5.1.1

All FacilitatorDAOs must immediately review the evidence and either support the decision to derecognize the AD, or propose a vote to overturn the derecognition and penalize the FacilitatorDAO.

###### 2.6.5.1.2

If FacilitatorDAOs fail to take action against misaligned ADs, they must be severely penalized.

#### 2.6.6: Aligned Delegate Operational Security

ADs must maintain a high level of operational security, and follow best practice for privacy, security and physical resilience. This must be done at a level that adequately protects the Maker Ecosystem from physical risk posed by the potential for attacks against ADs. If there’s clear evidence or significant suspicion that the operational security of an AD has been compromised, or that they have failed to follow best practice or otherwise made operational security errors, FacilitatorDAOs must immediately derecognize the AD. Half of the AD Buffer can be confiscated and used as a whistleblower bounty in case an ecosystem actor responsibly provided useful information for determining that the operational security of an AD was compromised. GOV6 must specify sufficient safety mechanisms around the payment of the whistleblower bounty.

##### 2.6.6.1

FacilitatorDAOs must err on the side of caution and act in case there is any kind of real possibility that the operational security of an AD is compromised. They are afforded a significant autonomy in making judgement calls related to operational security standards for ADs, but if there is clear indications that they are abusing this power for misaligned ends, then the FacilitatorDAO must be penalized for open misalignment.

###### 2.6.6.1.1

All FacilitatorDAOs must immediately either support the action or propose overturning it and penalizing the FacilitatorDAO when an operational security breach derecognition is initiated. Failing to act is itself misalignment and results in penalties for all the FacilitatorDAOs that failed to act.

### 2.7: FacilitatorDAOs and Facilitators

FacilitatorDAOs are a type of SubDAO that can be given responsibility over MakerDAO Scopes and SubDAO Scopes in return for tokenomics rewards.

#### 2.7.1

When a FacilitatorDAO has responsibility for an Alignment Artifact, they are fully required to follow all instructions and rules of the Alignment Artifact elements. If they fail to follow the instructions and rules correctly, they can be penalized by the Governance Scope. The penalties and process for penalizing must be specified in the Article 6 of the Governance Scope.

#### 2.7.2: Assigning Responsibility of MakerDAO Alignment Artifacts to FacilitatorDAOs

The Governance Scope must specify a process used by Maker Governance to assign responsibility of a particular MakerDAO Alignment Artifact to a particular FacilitatorDAO. A process must be in place to enable FacilitatorDAOs to request responsibility of a MakerDAO Alignment Artifact, and in ordinary times Maker Governance should only assign responsibility of a Scope based on a request by the FacilitatorDAO.

##### 2.7.2.1

All FacilitatorDAOs always have responsibility for the Governance Scope.

##### 2.7.2.2

There must always be a FacilitatorDAO assigned to all Scopes, and if necessary due to extraordinary circumstances, Maker Governance must directly assign responsibility of a Scope to a FacilitatorDAO. GOV7 must ensure a process for detecting and acting on such situations to minimize risk.

##### 2.7.2.3

If a FacilitatorDAO has responsibility for the Support Scope or the Stability Scope, they are considered Core Facilitators and cannot be assigned responsibility to SubDAO scopes.

#### 2.7.3: Assigning Responsibility of SubDAO Scopes to FacilitatorDAOs

GOV7 must specify the process with which AllocatorDAOs and MiniDAOs can assign Responsibility of their Scopes to FacilitatorDAOs. Being assigned responsibility of a SubDAO Scope requires the FacilitatorDAO to agree to take on the full responsibility of the Scope.

##### 2.7.3.1

Once a FacilitatorDAO has agreed to take responsibility, they cannot exit their responsibility with less than 3 months notice, unless justified by an event of misalignment or clear breach of good faith occurs.

##### 2.7.3.2

If a FacilitatorDAO does not have responsibility for the Support Scope or the Stability Scope, they are considered SubDAO Facilitators and can be assigned responsibility to SubDAO Scopes.

#### 2.7.4: FacilitatorDAO Responsibility Rewards

FacilitatorDAOs benefit from a special tokenomics system called FacilitatorDAO Responsibility Rewards, which rewards them based on the amount of Responsibility they have over Scopes.

A total of 300 million NewGovToken are distributed to all FacilitatorDAOs per year.

##### 2.7.4.1: MakerDAO Scope FacilitatorDAO Responsibility Rewards

120 million goes to responsibility for MakerDAO Scopes

###### 2.7.4.1.1

40 million is distributed proportionally to Scope Weight. Scope Weight is as follows:

| Scope | Scope Weight |
|---|---:|
| Support Scope | 3 |
| Protocol Scope | 1 |
| Stability Scope | 3 |
| Accessibility Scope | 1 |

When multiple FacilitatorDAOs are responsible for the same Scope their Scope Weight is divided between them.

###### 2.7.4.1.2

40 million NewGovToken is distributed according to Budget Weight

Budget Weight is calculated by determining the relative amount of budget each FacilitatorDAO controls, including both fixed budgets and Allocated Budgets. When multiple FacilitatorDAOs are responsible for the same Scope, the fixed budgets of the Scope are divided between them.

###### 2.7.4.1.2.1: Adjusted Budget Weight

In some cases Budgets will have specified an adjusted weight inside the Budget Element. This is in case the budget is not meant to be spent on a regular basis and as a result the actual number is higher than what would be used on average. The Adjusted weight must still account for the work involved in preparing for the contingency situation where the budget would need to be spent.

###### 2.7.4.1.3: Minimum Threshold

40 million NewGovToken is distributed proportionally to all Core FacilitatorDAOs.

##### 2.7.4.2: SubDAO Scope FacilitatorDAO Responsibility Rewards

180 million NewGovToken is provided as reward for Responsibility of SubDAO Scopes, divided accordingly:

###### 2.7.4.2.1

80 million NewGovenToken distributed according to AllocatorDAO Weight, which is determined by the proportional amount of Maker Elixir that the AllocatorDAO holds, compared to the total amount of Maker Elixir held by all AllocatorDAOs.

###### 2.7.4.2.2

60 million NewGovToken distributed according to MiniDAO Weight, which is determined by the proportional amount of Allocator Elixir the MiniDAO holds times the proportional amount of Maker Elixir its parent AllocatorDAO holds.

###### 2.7.4.2.3

40 million NewGovenToken proportionally for any FacilitatorDAO that is actively Responsible for at least 1 AllocatorDAO Scope, or at least a fraction of total MiniDAO Weight equivalent to one divided by the total amount of SubDAO FacilitatorDAOs.

#### 2.7.5: Facilitators

Facilitators are anonymous Alignment Conservers that can be engaged by FacilitatorDAOs to directly access governance processes and smart contracts that the FacilitatorDAOs control, to help ensure the FacilitatorDAO fulfills their responsibility under the Alignment Artifacts.

##### 2.7.5.0

Facilitators allow a FacilitatorDAO to scale up its ability to be responsible for multiple Alignment Artifacts, but also create the risk of misaligned Facilitators attacking the system or stealing funds.

##### 2.7.5.1

The FacilitatorDAOs are responsible for any wrongdoing by their chosen Facilitators, and will be penalized for any theft or abuse of budgets or protocol access. The FacilitatorDAOs have to manage this risk through carefully set, limited permissions and fallback mechanisms that ensure the FacilitatorDAOs cannot take a significant loss in the worst case scenario.

##### 2.7.5.2 Facilitator Operational Security

Facilitators must maintain a high level of operational security, and follow best practice for privacy, security and physical resilience. This must be done at a level that adequately protects the Maker Ecosystem from physical risk posed by the potential for attacks against Facilitators. If there’s clear evidence or significant suspicion that the operational security of a Facilitator has been compromised, or that they have failed to follow best practice or otherwise made operational security errors, FacilitatorDAOs must immediately derecognize the Facilitator. The FacilitatorDAO that chose a Facilitator that is found to have inadequate operational security must be penalized unless they act immediately to derecognize the Facilitator.

###### 2.7.5.2.1

FacilitatorDAOs must err on the side of caution and act in case there is any kind of real possibility that the operational security of an Facilitator is compromised. They are afforded a significant autonomy in making judgement calls related to operational security standards for Facilitators, but if there is clear indications that they are abusing this power for misaligned ends, then the FacilitatorDAO must be penalized for open misalignment.

###### 2.7.5.2.1.1

All FacilitatorDAOs must immediately either support the action or propose overturning it and penalizing the FacilitatorDAO when an operational security breach derecognition is initiated. Failing to act is itself misalignment and results in penalties for all the FacilitatorDAOs that failed to act.

#### 2.7.6: Decision-Making powers of FacilitatorDAOs

FacilitatorDAOs can make interpretations and take discretionary decisions based on the language of the Alignment Artifacts. *2.2* and *2.3* of The Atlas and GOV2 and GOV3 place significant checks and restrictions on how FacilitatorDAOs can do this. FacilitatorDAOs are not meant to be experts on how to run ordinary business operations, but instead must follow the instructions and make judgment calls based on the language contained in the Scopes.

##### 2.7.6.1

All FacilitatorDAO decisions related to ordinary operations must be clearly explained and justified based on public information. FacilitatorDAOs must not claim to make decisions based on some internal knowledge or undisclosed data.

###### 2.7.6.1.0

Generally, FacilitatorDAOs are supposed to minimally "think for themselves" and instead just faithfully follow the instructions of the Scopes and focus on the critical role of monitoring that the spirit of the Alignment Artifacts isn't violated.

##### 2.7.6.2

FacilitatorDAOs are allowed to take unilateral action based on the Alignment Artifacts in determining whether an Alignment Conserver or other governance participants are acting misaligned and must be derecognized. If there is evidence that an Alignment Conserver needs to be derecognized, all FacilitatorDAOs are responsible for taking action.

###### 2.7.6.2.1

FacilitatorDAOs that fail to take action against misalignment must be penalized, including failure to promptly derecognize ACs that have acted misaligned.

###### 2.7.6.2.2

FacilitatorDAOs control one or more EGF instances and must immediately remove derecognized ACs from their instances of the EGF.

###### 2.7.6.2.2.0

To prevent the damage possible for malicious or negligent abuse of the derecognition powers, each FacilitatorDAO controls only specific EGF instances. This means a single rogue FacilitatorDAO cannot instantly cut off all EGF access to an AD.

###### 2.7.6.2.3

If FacilitatorDAOs act misaligned and abuse the ability to derecognize ACs or abuse other leverage available to them under the guise of penalizing misaligned actions, they must themselves be severely penalized.

###### 2.7.6.2.3.1

All other FacilitatorDAOs must also be penalized if they don't immediately propose penalties when a FacilitatorDAO takes misaligned actions. If all FacilitatorDAOs are simultaneously misaligned, the situation can be resolved through the whistleblower process.

###### 2.7.6.2.4

All the restrictions that apply to FacilitatorDAOs also apply to Facilitators. Facilitators cannot directly engage with counterparties. The only exception to this rule is in situations where Facilitators are coordinating to set up governance processes, if the interactions are clearly documented.

##### 2.7.7.0

*It is critically important that all interactions by the Facilitators are documented, so there is clear documentation that details what work is required for the governance processes to function. This reduces the risk that things will fail if a particular Facilitator becomes inactive for any reason.*

### 2.8: Professional Ecosystem Actors - GOV8

Professional Ecosystem Actors are external actors that are paid through the Scopes to do important work that benefit the MakerDAO ecosystem. Two types of Professional Ecosystem Actors exist: Advisory Council Members and Active Ecosystem Actors. Advisory Council Members is the most direct check on Active Ecosystem Actors, and as a result there is significant conflict of interest risk that must be avoided by ensuring Ecosystem Actors always fall into only one category or the other.

#### 2.8.1: Advisory Council Member Ecosystem Actors

Advisory Council Member Ecosystem Actors perform research and publish advice for the DAO to use in improving the Scopes Artifacts and their contained processes. Often, this is used as a check for choosing the best Active Ecosystem Actors available to supply a need defined in a Scope Artifact. The work of Advisory Council Members is implemented exclusively through modifications to the Scope Artifacts, and can also be used to receive advice regarding the specific interpretation of Scope Artifacts (which, if followed, must then be included in the Scope Artifact).

The Scope Artifact improvements researched and suggested by the Advisory Council Members are presented to the ACs who then determine to what extent they want to follow their suggestions for designing MIP102s.

#### 2.8.2: Active Ecosystem Actors

Active Ecosystem Actors work according to the specifications of Scope Alignment Artifacts to receive funding for performing specific projects such as developing new features, performing data collection or analysis, performing marketing, growth, outreach or educational activities, legal work, government outreach, and other operational activities that benefit the Maker Ecosystem. Active Ecosystem Actors are the only type of actor that interacts with the Scopes that is allowed to do “real work” that isn’t strictly defined in, and bounded by, the Alignment Artifacts.

### 2.9: Interaction of Aligned Delegates, FacilitatorDAOs, and Advisory Council - GOV9​​​​​​​

#### 2.9.3: FacilitatorDAOs and Scope Advisory Councils

A critical governance interaction is ACs getting professional input from Advisory Council Members about specific improvements that are possible in the Scope Alignment Artifacts. This happens with the FacilitatorDAOs following the instructions defined in the Advisory Council Articles. FacilitatorDAOs can also provide input directly to ACs.

##### 2.9.3.2

FacilitatorDAOs follow the instructions in the Advisory Council Articles to propose the onboarding of new Advisory Council Members, and to allocate resources for Advisory Projects to existing Advisory Council Members.

### 2.10: Core Governance Security - GOV10

GOV10 must cover Governance Security processes for deploying and reviewing executive votes. This must include multiple types of security review and automated tests.

### 2.11: SubDAO Governance Security - GOV11

GOV11 must cover the minimum security rules related to SubDAO governance actions. This includes ensuring SubDAOs do not take unnecessary technical risk. It also covers defining and preserving the MKR holder veto over all SubDAO governance actions. Attempts by SubDAOs to circumvent or remove the protections from the MKR voter veto is considered misalignment.

### 2.12: Scope Bootstrapping - GOV12

Before the Endgame State, the Governance Scope articles must be modified to accommodate the needs of the bootstrapping phase leading up to the Endgame State, and to minimize transition costs and friction. GOV12 must also contain processes for quickly fixing issues in any scopes that put the bootstrapping of governance at risk.

The bootstrapping measures can override requirements and specifications in the Atlas as long as they are temporary and needed, and must all come to an end when the NewChain is launched.

## 3: The Support Scope

The Support Scope covers various critical tasks that support the ecosystem, including governance process infrastructure and management, SubDAO and Ecosystem Actor support, and management of the Public Good Purpose System.

### 3.1: Scope improvement - SUP1

SUP1 must cover the key specifications and processes necessary for the Scope to reliably improve itself long term without risk of misalignment.

#### 3.1.1

The Support Scope must have a specialized Advisory Council that is able to propose improvements to the language of the Scope Artifact that increases its Alignment Artifact Strength and increase efficiency and security of the Maker Ecosystem.

#### 3.1.2

The Support Scope must have a customized strategy towards its display and interaction through the DAO Toolkit to make it maximally user friendly.

### 3.3: DAO Toolkit Core Development - SUP3

The DAO Toolkit is a unified system for displaying the Alignment Artifacts and all of the data, processes and interaction necessary for Maker Governance and internal SubDAO governance to function optimally. It is distributed by all AllocatorDAOs and FacilitatorDAOs as a part of their SubDAO Frontend. SUP3 must cover all necessary processes to ensure its underlying technology develops appropriately.

#### 3.3.1

Core Development and Maintenance Management and Strategy.

#### 3.3.2

Identification and development of standardized, common reusable modules.

#### 3.3.5

Research and specification of best practice for using the DAO Toolkit by Scopes.

#### 3.3.6

Monitoring of adherence with best practice and flagging to governance in case of issues.

#### 3.3.7

Development of the client side Tookit AI systems for using the DAO Toolkit and interacting with the CAIS.

#### 3.3.8

Contributor and Alignment Conserver privacy tools and support.

### 3.4: Core Artificial Intelligence System (CAIS) - SUP4

MakerDAO must have a cutting edge system of diversified AI tools that is accessible by Alignment Conservers and tokengated for MKR holders and SubDAO token holders.

#### 3.4.1

SUP4 must define a robust and aligned solution for the core model to ensure it will have the greatest possible positive impact on the ability of Maker Governance to strengthen the Alignment Artifacts and monitor all governance processes for alignment and efficiency. The Core Model must also be a powerful tool for the incubation and growth of the SubDAOs.

#### 3.4.2

The CAIS must use a technical approach that is diversified, and continuously improved based on the latest science and practical experience of operating and using the CAIS.

#### 3.4.3

SUP4 must maintain a well balanced model for token gating access to CAIS, weighted in favor of MKR holders but ensuring that SubDAO token holders can also access and unleash the benefit of CAIS for SubDAO governance, innovation and growth.

### 3.5: Budgets, Milestones and results reporting standardization - SUP5

SUP5 must ensure that there is a solid baseline understanding of how to measure and monitor results and how to distinguish between goals that actually benefit the DAO and goals that are misaligned.

#### 3.5.1

SUP5 must develop and maintain best practices for how to ensure budgets are tightly connected to results and milestones, and that this connection is easy to understand and it is possible to comprehend whether a budget is performing or not.

#### 3.5.2

#### 4.3.5

The Native token standard allows NewGovToken and SubDAO tokens, and other tokens made with the Native token standard, to embed their tokens into an NFT following the native NFT standard, or mint a new NFT and embed into it. A token standard NFT can have its tokens extracted from the NFT again through the NFT marketplace simulation which penalizes extracting tokens from the NFT if a lot of users are extracting at the same time. The income from the penalties are then earned by the remaining NFT holders, increasing the amount of tokens embedded in their NFT.

##### 4.3.5.1

The parameters for extracting NewGovToken and SubDAO tokens from NFTs are 1% of the total embedded supply that can be extracted per day, and users willing to pay the highest penalty are extracted first.
