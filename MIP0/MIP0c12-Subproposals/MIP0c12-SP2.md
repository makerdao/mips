## Application Form
    
### Motivation

My first impressions of this when Rich suggested it were ‘your job is horrible, why would I want to do it?’ That said, there are some fairly compelling reasons why I feel like I should do it.
- It’s a concrete step towards decentralization of the DAO.
- Rich is overworked, and is often not able to give the role his full attention (though to be fair, he does a great job of balancing it with his other responsibilities.) Having a second facilitator should help to increase coverage.
- At this stage, there don’t appear to be viable alternative candidates (this is not meant to throw shade on anyone/everyone, if you disagree, please make yourself known.)

The plan has always been to have multiple facilitators sharing the work and representing different geographic groups. My hope is that we can get there as quickly as possible, but ultimately someone has to be first.

So, with all this in mind, I’d be willing to take the role, if you’ll all have me. Once we have other Facilitators in place, I may re-evaluate and either decide to step down or aim to move into a different role.

To mitigate slightly the whole 'this job is horrible' thing above: that's a rather over-exaggerated view. I expect to enjoy the role in the general case (or I wouldn't be agreeing to it), and I am completely happy to take on the responsibility for the foreseeable future.
