Core Personnel Role: Governance Facilitator
Core Personnel to be removed: Richard Brown
```

## Sentence Summary
MIP0c13-SP1 Offboards Richard Brown from the Governance Facilitator role.

## Removal Application and Supporting Evidence
    
### Motivation
As is now well-known, Richard Brown has recently chosen to leave the Maker Foundation. As far as I can tell, this departure was entirely on good terms. In addition, he has expressed a desire to step down from the Governance Facilitator Role effective immediately. 

This subproposal is largely a formality to confirm that decision and officially remove the authority and permissions Rich continues to hold under the MIPs process as a Governance Facilitator.

This subproposal should in no way be seen as a condemnation of, or a reaction to Rich's performance as Governance Facilitator. 

### Relevant Information
[Meeting Summary](https://github.com/makerdao/community/blob/master/governance/governance-and-risk-meetings/summaries/episode-102.md#rich-brown) in which Rich annouced his intention to step away from his role at the Foundation.
