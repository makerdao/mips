## Specification

### Motivation

- Why are you proposing this Core Unit?

### Core Unit ID

- To be assigned by the MIP Editor / Governance Facilitator when new.
- Specify the Core Unit ID if modifying an existing Core Unit.

### Core Unit Name

- Please write the proposed name of the Core Unit, being as specific as possible about the essence of what the Core Unit will be doing.

### Core Unit Mandate

- The Core Unit Mandate is the broad scope of what problems the Core Unit must solve, and what must be operated and maintained for the Core Unit to contribute to the success of the project.
- The Core Unit Mandate should be specific enough to ensure that Maker Governance has clarity about what problems it is solving when delegating resources to the Core Unit.
- Beyond that, the Core Unit Mandate should be as broad as possible in order to leave room for Facilitators to implement a flexible approach to solve the problems as the environment change.
- The Core Unit Mandate can also contain directives, guidelines or suggestions from Governance that helps inform Facilitators and Contributors of the Core Unit how to act in certain situations.
