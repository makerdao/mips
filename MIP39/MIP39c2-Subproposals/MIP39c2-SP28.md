## Sentence Summary

MIP39c2-SP28 adds Core Unit MT-001: Maker Talent.

## Paragraph Summary

MIP39c2-SP28 adds Core Unit MT-001: Maker Talent. Through the establishment of the Maker Talent Core Unit as a center of expertise, MakerDAO will get a competitive advantage in terms of attracting and retaining crypto talent, given the outstanding hiring/work experience they will be able to provide to their core contributors. At the same time, the Maker Talent CU will be able to make assessments and audit reports about the Core Units' best practices in the area of people management.

## Specification

### Motivation

#### The Problem

In a decentralized and open-source environment, the main source of competitive advantage ---in addition to mission and culture--- is the ability to provide an outstanding contributor experience from the moment they enter the DAO until they exit. The better the experience of the contributors with your people practices, the more eager they are willing to join and stay for the long term.

Keeping the above in mind and in order to be able to fully support the Sustainable Ecosystem Scaling Core Unit (SES-001) with their overall growth plans centred around scalability and measuring performance, we need to think more strategically about people practices without limiting the ability of each Core Unit to run autonomously.

### Core Unit Name

- Name: Maker Talent

### Core Unit ID

- ID: MT-001

### Core Unit Facilitators

- Discord: manomad#0321

### Core Unit Mandate

#### Mission

To give MakerDAO a competitive advantage in terms of attracting and retaining the best crypto talent by building the most outstanding hiring/contributing experience in the industry.

#### Vision

In order to build the best hiring/contributing experience, we will establish a Talent Core Unit that will act as a center of expertise, researching, designing, and deploying the best people practices for a DAO ecosystem so that CUs are empowered to autonomously attract and retain core contributors in the most efficient manner.

## Strategy

Given the agile, decentralized nature of MakerDAO, we will be leveraging the *contributor experience* a core contributor has with the different touchpoints (hiring, onboarding, goal setting, performance, compensation, learning, internal mobility, exiting) along their journey in the DAO as the central driver for defining challenges, needs and priorities. This “actively listening in” to our contributor community will be facilitated by the deployment of a **contributor experience management platform.**

### Goals

While we will be building the whole set of experiences a contributor has with the DAO from entry to exit, we have selected the following priorities for 2022 based on stakeholder input, "dependables", expected ROI and expected bandwidth:

1. Build the talent acquisition infrastructure based on the different parts of the mapped out candidate journey:

2. Design and deploy other touchpoints of the contributor experience that are needed to build a properly functioning talent acquisition infrastructure:
    - Improve our workforce planning to more proactively forecast the demand for contributors and resources needed.
    - Get a proper job evaluation system in place that can determine the impact and complexity of each role relative to one another. This is a very technical process that requires analyzing each role in depth and breadth, within the same Core Unit and across others. All this must be linked to a fair and equitable compensation system that can be used across CUs (similar to the MKR retention bonus plan).
    - Automate the admin onboarding for core contributors, which is all about the practical onboarding of core contributors to the DAO rather than the onboarding of people into the MakerDAO ecosystem.
3. Underpin all touchpoints of the contributor experience with an Experience Management Platform (integration layer) which enables ongoing contributor listening in so we can continuously measure and further optimize the different experiences.
    - Given that the contributor experience will be the measurement for the success of Maker Talent and central to defining challenges and priorities, we need to underpin all touchpoints of the contributor experience with an experience management platform that pulls data indicating how good or how bad their experience is with a particular people practice.
    - This is a very innovative way of being able to listen in to the contributors on an ongoing basis that will enable us to take swift action and apply fixes wherever needed.

### Road Map for 2022

![Roadmap](https://github.com/makerdao/mips/blob/master/MIP39/MIP39c2-Subproposals/supporting_materials/MIP39c2-SP28/Roadmap.png)

#### Q1

- Creation of the Core Unit onboarding MIP set, feedback and submission for voting

#### Q2

- Build Sourcing Channels for active candidates (General and specialized Job Boards, social media display ads)
- Build Sourcing channels for passive candidates (2.0 Employee Referral Tool, Educational institutes, Blockchain Associations, Social Media Chat groups, Hackaton/Gitcoin Quest, direct sourcing Linkedin).

Referral Tool Software: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLKGRBDgHto

-  Develop Recruitment Marketing Toolkit (Branded Templates, Merch, Booths) to be leveraged by CUs for recruitment purposes
-  Define contributor value proposition for MakerDAO in general and CUs in specific (80/20) to be leveraged for recruitment purposes
-  Improve workforce planning and forecasting demand in partnership with SES-001 and CUs
-  Design Job Evaluation System (create job description library and determine the impact and complexity of each role relative to one another within the same CU and across others) that later on can be linked to a fair and equitable compensation system
- Digitize and improve the virtual core contributor pre-boarding/onboarding journey by creating engaging pathways ensuring you can easily find your way around as a newcomer from the start. The same software can be used later on for offboarding, re-boarding, off-site coordination, onboarding community members in the ecosystem, etc.
