## Sentence Summary

MIP39c2-SP32 adds the Events Core Unit (EVENTS-001) to coordinate and execute MakerDAO branded events at Crypto/DEV Conference locations.

## Paragraph Summary

The Events Core Unit will handle planning, organization, and execution of MakerDAO branded events.  Our vision is to use an exhaustive list of themes, visuals, set dressing, technology and branding to carry out events to the highest standards for the MakerDAO community.

## Specification

### Motivation

#### The Absence of Maker

It has been identified that MakerDAO currently has no event presence at crypto conferences.  This lack of presence has a negative impact on Maker's brand.

#### Maker as a Household Name

MakerDAO must have an outward presence at crypto events.  This must be a more strategic approach than previous events.  The events must include outward branding of Maker and its products creating a unique experience utilizing various set dress branding techniques such as physical logos, artwork, LED light installations, branded visual content, projection mapping, and digital promotion.  Everyone who attends the event will leave knowing they were at a MakerDAO event.

An additional advantage of these events will be the large and highly visible brand awareness towards the crypto developer community in attendance.

### Mission

To provide the best MakerDAO branded event experience to the crypto & Maker community including industry professionals, influencers, and enthusiasts.
### Vision
EVENTS-001 is a team of passionate creative professionals with extensive experience in event organization and a high level of technical experience in LED Lighting, Visual Installations/Animation, and branding.
The team will leverage these skills to elevate the industry knowledge and awareness of MakerDAO and its products through a series of events held at various international locations.  

## Strategy

The Events team approach is to execute 5 MakerDAO events per year.  Three of these events will be considered “major” events.  A major event is targeted at high attendance conferences.  The major events will focus on new branded themes utilizing visual animations, LED lighting installations, projection mapping, LED logos, and internationally recognized artists.  Apart from the organization and promotion of the event, there will be a high focus on seamless integration of visuals, lighting, and music to create a high-level event experience.

Also included in our strategy are two “minor” events.  The target of these events is to host at a time in between major events.  The focus will still be outward branding, music, and visual elements but will be a scaled-down version of the major events.  The team would reuse visual themes and LED elements from the major events.  The musical element would utilize a local artist to keep the cost and scale of the event down.

Branding visuals is a large focus of our strategy at these events.  Some examples of these elements the team plans to implement at the events are as follows:
* BPM sync branded visual animations for use with LED video panels or traditional projection
* LED branded logos
* Synchronized LED wristbands to the visual and music elements
* 3D LED pixel mapping,  create the effect of a 3D hologram type effect which will include branding elements
* Addressable LED lighting installations
* Projection mapping of branded elements
* Complete synchronization and integration of LED Logos, house lighting, and installations with visual and music elements

### Launch Pad

The events can also serve as a launch pad for new Maker products.  The Events CU can assist the promotion of products by adding the branding or incorporating the product launch into the theme.  During the event planning, we would work closely with any CU's which wish to take advantage of this to assist in the success of their product launch.

### Event Documentation
#### Photos
Event documentation plays a big part in contributing to the CU strategy. For each event, a photographer will be hired to photograph the night/attendees. The photos will be used for event recaps and future promotion on social media platforms. [An example of these photos can be found here, which were captured from the Maker ETH Denver event.](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/102zcAv0b_i4op36UO0MSLWB80hGajIHa?usp=sharing)

#### Videos

For Major events, a videography team will be hired and coordinated to capture the event. The based output from the videographers will be  3 fully edited recaps of the night. A one-minute recap and two- thirty-second recaps.  These would be used on social media as a post-event recap and also for future event promotion.  The video team hired for the Maker ETH Denver event produced the following three videos.

## Pilot Event

### ETH Denver Summary

During the 2022 ETH Denver conference, the first MakerDAO branded event “DAIvinity” was trialed at The Church Nightclub to great fanfare.  The team planned and executed an event full of Maker branding including LED logos, digital Maker & DAI branded animations to the attendance of 1.000 people.  Additionally two internationally recognized DJs were curated for the night, [Miss Monique](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClIIy-aQBXRi1OHupBcrjJw) & [Sean Tyas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sean_Tyas).  Since the event, the buzz from the community has been unanimously lauding, with [Bankless even giving the event a formidable shout out](https://newsletter.banklesshq.com/p/8-things-you-missed-at-ethdenver-ab5?utm_source=url).
 
### Venue

ETH Denver gave a great opportunity to host the MakerDAO event at the famous Church venue.  The venue is internationally acclaimed and recognized in the DJ community.

### Visuals & LED Bracelets

The Church featured LED video screens throughout the entire venue, offering the team a great branding opportunity for MakerDAO.  At the DAIvinity event, the team hired and coordinated with a visual animator to create custom Maker & DAI branded animations as well as a library of more abstract sequences for the night.  

Mapped to video screens lining the main venue floor on 3 sides the visuals created a panoramic experience that was controlled live through the entire event to closely sync the music, visuals, and custom procedural effects and content.

In addition to the visuals, DMX-controlled LED bracelets were given to the guests.  These LED brackets were completely synced with the music and the colours of the visual content.  [The bracelets can be seen featured in the recap videos](https://youtu.be/-QEjIxaC9WY).

## 2022/2023 Planning

To achieve the CU mandate of 3 major events and 2 minor events the following are the proposed locations for the 2022/2023 fiscal year.  

### Major Events

The major events are targeted to the largest attended conferences.  These have been identified as the following;
* ETHCC - July 19-21, 2022
* DEVcon (Bogotá, Colombia) - Oct 11-14, 2022
* ETH Denver - Feb 2023

*Note that these locations are only proposed and not final.  If CU’s agree that a major event should be moved to another conference then the Events CU will update accordingly.  CU’s will need to request a change of location with a minimum of 3 months in advance due to the logistical planning required for a major event.*

### Minor Events

The 2 minor events are planned in between the major events.  The Events team will consult closely with the Maker community and other Core Units to determine the most effective locations. Attendance to minor conferences is uncertain until 1 to 2 months before the conference so the Events team will have to adjust accordingly.  During the incubation of this Core Unit, ETH Amsterdam was identified as a minor event location.  The event is currently being planned and executed during the date range of April 20-24, 2022.  

### Partnerships

The Events CU plans to leverage partnerships with other protocols for these events.  The partnerships will allow for cross-promotion and cost offsetting of the CU budget.  From the cross-promotion aspect Maker will be able to tap into the partners' audience,  this will allow for broader exposure and interaction with a different audience Maker may draw by itself.  The partners for the event would be expected to cost split the event sub budgets with the Events CU.  The split ratio would be discussed before the event during the planning phase.  Maker would always retain a majority share to ensure the event is Maker focused.  Creative and operation control would always remain with the Events CU.  An example of the potential cost reduction impact to the CU budget is highlighted in the DAI budget MIP40c3-SP66 under the Partnerships section.

## Core Unit Team
The Events CU team has been carefully curated to include expertise and skills to execute the ambitious vision of the MakerDAO events.  First and foremost is precision organization and execution of all aspects related to the events.  The Event Manager must be highly effective at communication and planning while remaining flexible to accommodate and resolve any unforeseen issues during the event execution.  The Event Manager will be the first point contact for event personnel and contractors.  This will ensure communication is consistent, clear and effective. 

The goal of the Events team is to be as vertically integrated as possible which is why the team has included a mechanical engineer role in the CU.  The engineer will be responsible for all technical aspects and coordination of visual elements, LED lighting and other event installations.  The engineer will additionally be responsible for the design and manufacturing of set dress, including LED lighting.   Safety analysis of rigging/installations would be performed by the engineer to ensure compliance with any local safety requirements or authorities.
