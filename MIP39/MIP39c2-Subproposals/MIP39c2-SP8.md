## Specification

## Paragraph Summary

The Governance Communications Core Unit performs a complementary set of resources and services that focus on MakerDAO's informational accessibility and communication practices as a public organization.

**Vision**

A healthy communication and information infrastructure:

* Makes consistent, comprehensive, and accurate information accessible.
* Has well-managed public communication venues.
* Engages with stakeholders to improve its output.
* Provides dedicated support and multiple points of access to members of the media.
* Advocates for, facilitates, and promotes beneficial organizational communication practices.
* Maps the organization and its surrounding stakeholder ecosystem.
* Results in a more effective and less opaque organization that attracts more stakeholders.

## Motivation

Now that MakerDAO has completed the launch of Multi-Collateral Dai, followed by very strong growth, *it is time to focus on improving MakerDAO as a public organization*, not just as a technology.

MakerDAO is a multi-headed rapidly-growing organization with many categories of focus and numerous stakeholder groups. As a result, our stakeholders face many difficulties; keeping up with the growing volume and complexity of information, spending too much time searching, filtering noise, understanding Maker lingo, not knowing who is a point of contact for what, inability to make it to all the meetings, and more. These are only some of the barriers to increasing the quality of their experience working with us, and as we grow these will only get worse and worse.

**Our motivation is to improve MakerDAO's performance as a public organization by removing information and communication barriers for stakeholders.** A dedicated communications team is fundamental for strengthening MakerDAO’s dependability day-to-day and in crisis situations. Such a team would help MakerDAO operate more effectively as a public organization, become more transparent and reliable, increase trustworthiness among stakeholders, and ultimately attract more business interest.

## Team Structure

The Governance Communications Core Unit will function as a self-managing entity with a hierarchical management structure. Contributors and Project Managers answer to the Facilitator, who then answers to MKR holders and the wider community.

The three main roles in this Core Unit are Facilitator, Project Manager, and Contributor. The contributor role is not a full-time role. If a contributor is interested in a full-time role, they become a project manager.

## Team Credentials

## Working Philosophy

_Aggregate and Simplify. Stakeholders need to be kept informed._

This team works on a variety of projects and is fully remote. This means that as a team we embrace the concept of agile workflows, pair and group working sessions, mutual accountability, and getting things done. As part of our day-to-day, we:

* Consider how each of our projects can be improved and iterated on. 
* Maintain an open culture for discussion, collaboration, and learning.
* Are unafraid to voice concerns or give constructive feedback.
* Embrace a shared decision-making methodology to avoid getting stuck as a team.
* Maintain active relationships with mandated actors and the greater stakeholder community.
* Aim to constantly raise the bar for quality and coverage.
* Keep a tight coupling with the Governance Core Unit and the community to ensure communication needs are being met.
