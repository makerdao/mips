## Sentence Summary

MIP39c2-SP8 adds Core Unit COM-001: Governance Communications.

## Specification

## Motivation

The Maker Protocol is a complex system with many different categories of focus. To name a few, we have Collateral Inclusion, Parameter setting, Smart Contract Upgrades, Oracles, Integrations, and more. **The main problem is that keeping up is challenging for the average stakeholder. Our motivation is to provide solutions to this challenge.**

“Aggregate and simplify” is a phrase we’ve used to capture the essence of what we do. MakerDAO and its stakeholders will benefit from a dedicated team following and documenting developments at MakerDAO, making information more accessible to all.

Additionally, a Governance Communications Core Unit strengthens MakerDAO’s dependability in emergency situations by having a historical and established communications infrastructure that stakeholders can count on.

Onboarding the Governance Communications Core Unit secures a fundamental team needed at MakerDAO to improve MakerDAO’s communications infrastructure by offering a range of communications products and services.

## Team Structure

The three main roles in this Core Unit are Facilitator, Project Manager, and Contributor. The contributor role is not a full-time role. If a contributor is interested in a full-time role, they become a project manager.
