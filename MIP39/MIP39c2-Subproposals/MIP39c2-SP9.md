## Specification

## Paragraph Summary


The Strategic Marcomms unit aims to take MakerDAO to the next level of growth through outreach, branding, marketing, and ads campaigns. It will focus on MakerDAO's target audience groups and markets. Our objectives are:

 * Increasing the awareness of Dai and the Maker Protocol
 * Boosting Dai adoption through promotions and partnerships
 * Addressing marketing and PR-related needs from other core units such as priming potential partners for business development and RWA adoption-related discussions
 * Evolving and collaborating with other units and the community

 The unit, formed by experienced professionals and passionate community members, will oversee the marketing and communications for MakerDAO.

## Motivation

The MakerDAO community is energetic and highly engaged, thanks to the core community's concerted efforts and initiatives. The unit recognizes that reaching new audiences and users is vital for Dai's mass adoption. Based on that conclusion, the unit is formed to be dedicated to outreach.

We are proposing this unit to the DAO because it delivers the following:

* A clear, consistent, and coordinated communication across key channels
* A cohesive global branding with a strong focus on marketing strategy tailored for each major regions that match the needs suitable for each stage of growth in Dai adoption

The core unit plays an essential role in helping the general public, or those outside the core community, learn about MakerDAO as it enters the next growth phase. The unit builds on the recognition MakerDAO has gained in the cryptocurrency space and expands into the mainstream.

* The strategic communications portion protects the credibility of MakerDAO by providing an accurate understanding of MakerDAO, and clear and consistent messaging
* The unit highlights milestones and provides information in a language that anyone can understand.
* The marketing component ensures a continuation of marketing activity to push Dai adoption further and increase the visibility of MakerDAO.
* The unit will focus on localized and tailor-made marketing efforts in each key region.

As the Maker Foundation dissolves, more information and clarity will be required during this period of change.

* The DAO needs a team with ample experience and a proven track record to ensure a smooth transition through coherent communication to the general public and regional communities.
* The unit will also jumpstart the marketing efforts without delays to further expand the MakerDAO ecosystem. The team consists of individuals that have persistently demonstrated their ability to achieve results.

The unit will implement the following PR strategies and focus on the marketing channels listed below with several new ideas introduced in stage throughout the year:

  * Blog and other contents (owned media) - Create blog content and utilize platforms such as Clubhouse to gather audience and followers
* Word-of-Mouth - Dai's benefits and the story of MakerDAO can be explained more effectively with more credibility when it is from a third-party such as Dai users and partners, and advocates. The unit will pursue and provide opportunities for others to share their experiences.

## Regional approach

One size doesn’t fit all. The unit utilizes its expertise and understanding of each region to design the following strategies and plans.

Targeted regions are in different stages, with unique challenges and opportunities:

**EUROPE**

This is a very active region in the crypto space, with several hubs, universities, alliances and initiatives driving the ecosystem development and key events taking place here.

* Europe has a large local crypto community but usage of Dai outside of the community is still very limited. Our top priority in Europe will be to leverage the local communities for growth in Dai usage.
* Region is characterised by relatively easy access to the exchanges, wallets and crypto service providers, where Dai can be bought, sold, or used. Tapping into the shared interest of making people use crypto, we will seek to launch marketing campaigns focused on bringing in new Dai users, in collaboration with these providers.
* The diversity among the countries in the region in terms of language, culture, financial landscape, and geopolitics is vast. We find it best to concentrate on the countries with most spoken languages and localize our efforts via providing translated materials (English, German, Spanish, Italian) and direct our communication efforts via the most popular channels (twitter, etc.).

**AFRICA**

Africa has high demand for financial services like loans, savings/investment and international payments. Research, exploration and education have the priority and will be our initial marketing focus.

* After researching and identifying where crypto can be used (internet access, mobile) and where there already are crypto financial services (or where they can be incentivized to be created), we will be able to better motivate potential users to try out Dai and DeFi, and can facilitate the education.
* As a way to improve financial literacy and overcome high barriers to access the financial services, there's a need for education regarding to money via introductory campaigns and similar initiatives.
* Our marketing approach will not merely transfer US/Europe-centric strategy to Africa, it will take into account region’s unique infrastructure and leapfrogging development to employ locally relevant and meaningful communication channels and platforms (e.g. radio show popularity and social media like facebook that fall under free data policy by the local operators).

**METAVERSE**

Not bound by geographical location, this environment provides a parallel virtual world that has a potential to become the primary interaction environment for the MakerDAO community, which is first and foremost online. Maker has several engagements in these worlds that are waiting for the full utilization.

* Building on the past success, we will continue hosting virtual events and associated gamifying activities in our community houses.
* This novel realm has the potential for socializing, collaboration, creation and entertainment purposes. It is worth testing our assumptions for the use of the parcels & builds at our disposal, to find out which fit MakerDAO’s needs best.
* Furthermore, metaverse is ideal to attract a novel type of Dai user (digital art, gaming, collectors, etc.). Using the immersive visual element is great for demonstrating basic concepts in an interactive manner, making it more digestible and fun to learn.

**ASIA**

Asia region is a diverse market that consists of pockets of opportunities and tremendous potentials for growth in markets such as China and Southeast Asia. For our strategy to be effective, each key market's approach needs to be specific and tailored to that market. The regulatory landscape regarding crypto also varies. While each country has a different culture and languages, the unit's contributors can create synergies by sharing successful initiatives and resources.

**CHINA**

China is one of the biggest markets for MakerDAO, with well-established communities. The country’s unique and secluded social media channels are vital to the success of user engagement. The regulatory attitude towards cryptocurrency changes over time. Under such a dynamic landscape, an in-depth understanding of the market and special attention are required when communicating and conducting marketing activities. Education and communication are the primary focuses.

* Actively manage local social media channels (Weibo and Wechat)
* Localizing content, including Maker websites, to effectively reach the Chinese audience
* Create and compile culturally appealing and fundamentals oriented educational content
* Provide truthful and easily-digested information and resources to the press
* Keep good relationship with the public sectors

**JAPAN**

Japan has a strong crypto community that is enthusiastic about learning, even though the general public remains skeptical about crypto. Our focus has been to increase the understanding of the DeFi market through meetups and content through education and meetups. Engaging in dialogues with regulators also is crucial to dai adoption in the country.

* Increase Maker’s visibility by providing educational content and marketing campaigns that are catered to the non-crypto audience
* Localized content includes blogs and share information via
  * Social media such as Twitter and Facebook
  * Hands-on workshop
  * Blogs
* Combining marketing campaigns with easy-step challenges to make learning easy and interesting
* Fostering community in Japan by contributing to meetups and collaborating with organizations and partners
* Engage in dialogue with regulators through DeFi advocacy groups

**SOUTH KOREA**

South Korea has one of the most developed IT/internet infrastructures in the world. The Korean government and fintech industries are especially interested in blockchain technology and crypto, while the regulation is more specified. Furthermore, South Korea is known for having a very active crypto community discussing Blockchain and crypto through numerous mainstream and social media.

* Provide local content via mainstream/social media, blogs, on/off-line events, etc.
* Manage local communication channels including Kakaotalk and Telegram for better understanding
* Help Korean people(companies, users, researchers, developers, students, etc.) use and collaborate with Maker for the broader Maker ecosystem

**SOUTHEAST ASIA**

Southeast Asia has a very diverse cultural and regulatory landscape. Singapore is one of the more lax SEA markets for crypto-specific regulations, and it is also a very crypto-friendly hub in Asia. Vietnam and the Philippines are ranked top 10 in global remittance in fiat remittances and therefore requires local content curation and presence to

* Increase awareness of MakerDAO in the emerging markets, e.g., Vietnam and Indonesia
* Leverage Ambassador program in SEA to build and ramp up local communities

**MIDDLE EAST**

Dubai has become the world capital of blockchain development. It has implemented 24 use cases across eight industry sectors -- finance, education, real estate, tourism, commerce, health, transportation, and security -- and launching the Dubai Blockchain Platform, and the Dubai Blockchain Policy. The Dubai Blockchain Strategy will be part of the “Smart Dubai” initiative.
