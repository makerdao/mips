## Sentence Summary

Refresh the mandate of Core Unit IS-001: Immunefi Security

## Paragraph Summary

Refresh the mandate of Core Unit IS-001: Immunefi Security

## Specification

### Motivation

With the extensive growth of the DeFi ecosystem, as well as crypto as a whole, comes greater threats. Though a significant increase in both community sizes and funds within the ecosystem indicates a maturing environment, the glitter of success also attracts nefarious individuals and groups seeking to damage the ecosystem in exchange for their own personal gains.

While some aspects of cybersecurity within the space are well-known, primarily software audits, the shift in the ecosystem indicates a need for more proactive as well as reactive measures. With MakerDAO not only being one of the largest ecosystems in the space but also a pioneer in the push for decentralization, it is a prime target for these nefarious people. We wish to prevent, or, at the very least, minimize the negative effects of their intended actions.

#### Mission

Systematically improve security for builders, end users, and other stakeholders in the Maker Ecosystem by providing both reactive and proactive security services.

#### Vision

A Maker ecosystem with the right security measures, including regular self-evaluation for constant improvement, in order to allow the ecosystem builders and users to focus on innovation and adoption.

This is achieved through:

- Security Operations
   1. **Bug Bounty Program** - An industry-leading bug bounty program to adequately incentivize whitehat hackers to look for vulnerabilities in the Maker codebase as well as blackhat hackers to responsibly disclose vulnerabilities instead of exploiting them.
   2. **Monitoring of Critical Infrastructure** - At the pleasure and direction of TechOps and engineering teams, run and maintain monitoring software for critical infrastructure.
   3. **Incident Response Facilitation** - Fill gaps in internal expertise to minimize damages to the Maker ecosystem in the event of a successful attack.

- Community Support
   1. **Education and Advisory** - Review and update security-related aspects of MakerDAO’s operations. Create security resources available to all Core Units and the wider Maker community, as well as provide on-call security advisory services to foster a culture where security is taken more seriously.

### Core Unit ID

IS-001

### Core Unit Name

Immunefi Security

### Core Unit Mandate

The overall goal of the Immunefi Security CU is to secure the Maker ecosystem through multiple angles by leveraging its existing and growing security community and expertise. This involves dedicated services to the Maker ecosystem, effectively establishing a security partnership with the DAO. The CU will also aim to complement and collaborate with existing and future CUs instead of competing with them, leveraging existing processes, infrastructure, and information, among others, in order to deliver greater value to the Maker ecosystem.

As a pioneer in the DeFi space with billions in funds in the protocol, the Maker ecosystem is an attractive target for blackhat hackers who look to steal funds or disrupt the protocol. With millions lost regularly in the cryptocurrency space, it is likely that the Maker protocol, its key people, and its key infrastructure, are targeted on a regular basis.

Due to budgetary constraints, much of our CU’s mandate is aspirational. Our minimal service level includes the Bug Bounty Program, Monitoring of Critical Infrastructure, and close scrutiny of security-related issues. Scrutiny includes engagement in forum discussions on security related topics, polls to probe for changes in security policy, and governance fire drills.

#### Bug Bounty Program

The Immunefi Security CU will orient its growing community of security researchers on the Immunefi bug bounty platform towards the Maker ecosystem. Leveraging its expertise with bug bounty programs across the cryptocurrency space, especially the DeFi ecosystem, the Immunefi Security CU will maintain the [MIP64](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP64) bug bounty program to economically incentivize further investigation of the code.

The program will attract whitehat hackers who find vulnerabilities and responsibly disclose them, so they are fixed before they can be exploited. Additionally, this provides an incentivized opportunity for disclosure of vulnerabilities instead of exploitation for blackhat hackers.

In order to achieve this, the Immunefi Security CU will:

* Coordinate with various CUs in order to identify the scope of assets as well as impacts to ensure that bugs reported are those that are valuable to the ecosystem.
* Maintain the program by incorporating additional content where needed, such as additional requirements for submissions, restrictions, and information, adding and removing scope as needed, and including various improvements from knowledge gained through the operation of the overall Immunefi platform. If necessary, the Immunefi Security CU will create separate bug bounty programs for different areas, for example smart contracts vs. cloud infrastructure.
* Triage all vulnerability reports and escalate to the appropriate CU as needed.
* Publicly report all critical vulnerabilities after all fixes have been implemented and verified in the format of a postmortem, and respond to inquiries from the community.

#### Incident Response Facilitation

Even with an effective Bug Bounty Program and appropriate incentives in place, there are always those who don’t care about these incentives, or believe that they can get away cleanly with more funds than the bug bounty program reward. This is why the Maker ecosystem should still be prepared to react appropriately in the event of a serious successful attack.

The Immunefi Security CU will collaborate to fill gaps in internal expertise to minimize the impact of attacks.

* PR specialists to take a proactive role in framing the perception of the exploit in a constructive manner, with the appropriate legal review of public statements.
* Community coordinators to assist existing community organizers and managers in dealing with the immediate aftermath of the exploit.

#### Monitoring of Critical Infrastructure

In April 2022, Lázaro Raúl of Nethermind, funded by Forta, put together a suite of monitoring agents for MakerDAO to promote their new Forta platform. TechOps and engineering teams consented to allow Immunefi Security CU to run and maintain these monitoring tools. We welcomed this responsibility and anticipate adding to our monitoring capabilities in the future.

#### Education and Advisory

As a last pillar of our strategy, the Immunefi Security CU will provide educational resources and on-call advisory, especially those for areas not covered by the Full Spectrum Security Service.

* Review and update the security related content of official MakerDAO manuals and documentation. Engage in forum discussions on security related topics. Run polls to probe for changes in security policy.
* Provide content that is accessible to the wider community, including resources for end users, with prioritization determined after getting feedback from other CUs
* Conduct live seminars and workshops for Maker ecosystem projects and CUs, with a focus on smart contract security, including bringing in experts from the wider ecosystem to provide up-to-date security information.
* Be accessible to all Maker projects and CUs for advisory on security-related matters in the form of an open questions and answers channel as well as an office hours call at least twice a month.
* Collaborate with CUs that need to provision security processes, such as the SES CU when new CUs are being onboarded.
