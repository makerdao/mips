## Sentence Summary

MIP39c2-SP34 splits the current Real World Finance Core Unit (RWF-001) into two separate Core Units and allocate the **existing** RWF-001 personnel and budget between the two separate Core Units. The proposal:

- Iterates from @williamr’s [original vision for RWAs](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/short-take-exciting-news-and-opportunity-for-rwa-teams/16849).
- Promotes decentralization.
- Encourages competition.
- Reflects the global nature of Maker’s opportunities and the different time zones of the key contributors

## Paragraph Summary

MIP39c2-SP34 splits the current Real World Finance Core Unit (RWF-001) into two separate Core Units and allocate the **existing** RWF-001 personnel and budget between the two separate Core Units.

The two Core Units will be RWF-0x and RWF-001. The existing RWF-001 budget for personnel and operational expenditures (including external legal) will be allocated as follows:

- RWF-0x: 75%
- RWF-001: 25%

The Core Unit Facilitator for RWF-0x will be @christiancdpetersen.

The Core Unit Facilitator for RWF-001 will remain @williamr.

**The proposal will not increase the administrative overhead for Maker token holders.** Instead, the division of the existing Core Unit will encourage decentralization, specialization, transparency, accountability, and efficiency.

## Specification

### Motivation

The current RWF-001 Core Unit Facilitator has long-standing relationships with some of the existing and potential MIP6 applicants. Further, the current RWF-001 Facilitator enhances Maker’s geographical diversity with a physical location in the Asia-Pacific. The split will allow RWF-001 to dedicate time to focus on opportunities in the Asia-Pacific region and not be impeded by the transactional demands of RWF-0x and associated transactions.

Prospective RWF-0x Core Unit members have, working jointly:

- Successfully structured, implemented and onboarded [Huntingdon Valley Bank](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/huntingdon-valley-bank-hvb-rwa-collateral-onboarding-risk-assessment/15828) and [Société Générale](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/sg-forge-socgen-risk-assessment/15638) (130MM DAI in RWAs).
- Through the aforementioned transactions, developed the market standard for how RWAs are ledgered and financed on-chain.
- Professionalized the onboarding of real-world assets by developing and communicating [investment guidelines](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/methodology-for-review-of-mip6-structured-finance-transactions/12697).
- Transparently reviewed MIP6 applications and made reasoned recommendations for proposed collateral onboardings ([for](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/mip6-huntingdon-valley-bank-loan-syndication-collateral-onboarding-application/14219/18) or [against](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/monetalis-mip6-collateral-onboarding-risk-evaluation/13658)).
- Collaborated with Centrifuge to scale the Centrifuge offering for Maker through the [indentured trust](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/what-is-a-trust-indenture-what-is-an-indenture-trustee/14697).
- Enriched the [discourse](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/a-north-star-dai-as-the-destination/14838) around and long-term [framework](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/charting-a-path-for-rwas-part-2-the-maker-standard/16725) for how to approach RWAs more holistically.
- Implemented [mechanisms](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/real-world-finance-decision-making-and-delegated-committee-proposal/15276) to improve Maker token holder [visibility](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/huntingdon-valley-bank-transaction-documents-on-permaweb/16264) over collateral.
- Demonstrated a propensity for working with one another synergistically.

As RWAs become increasingly fundamental to the success of the DAO, this reorganization supports the appropriate specialization and decentralization needed to proceed responsibly.

The Maker token holders will benefit from a division of the existing Real World Finance core unit into two separate core units for the following reasons:

- Separate Core Units will encourage contributors with similar skill sets, commercial approaches, and execution styles to collaborate more effectively, efficiently, and innovatively for the benefit of the Maker token holders.
- Separate Core Units will provide an opportunity for Maker token holders to measure and evaluate independent performance, as each Core Unit will be responsible for the development, execution, and maintenance of its transactions.
- Separate Core Units will promote more diverse innovation within and without the Maker ecosystem.
- Separate Core Units will result in more decentralization, dispersion, and competition with the best approaches and innovations winning out.
- Separate Core Units do not change or limit the authority of the Maker token holders. Over time, the Maker token holders may elect to devolve more or less authority to the Core Units depending on the Core Unit’s performance.
- Separate Core Units give potential MIP6 applicants more diverse options.
- Splitting the current Real-World Finance Core Unit achieves a strategic objective without associated fiscal expansion --- a nice double-whammy during a bear market.

### Core Unit ID

RWF-0x

### Core Unit Name

RWF-0x

### Core Unit Mandate

Each of RWF-0x and RWF-001 will be independently responsible for the development, prioritization, and execution of its own generated transactions greenlit by the Maker token holders.

RWF-0x and RWF-001 will compete for mandates from potential customers to the Maker protocol.

Subsequent to the initial split budget, RWF-0x and RWF-001 may propose their own budgets, incentives, etc.

Each of RWF-0x and RWF-001 will continue to interface with other Maker DAO Core Units as necessary to implement transactions.

Unless the Maker token holders determine another allocation on existing collateral:

- RWF-0x will be responsible for Huntingdon Valley Bank, Société Générale, 6S Capital, and New Silver.
- RWF-001 will be responsible for Fortunafi, ConsolFreight, and Harbor Trade Credit.

In respect of existing or greenlit MIP6 applications, RWF-001 will be responsible for Robinland and ATD Combustors. RWF-0x will be responsible for Pando (if greenlit).

For pre-greenlit MIP6 applications arising after the date of submission of this MIP proposal, MIP6 applicants may choose to interact with either RWF-0x or RWF-001.

RWF-0x and RWF-001 will coordinate activities to ensure that other Core Units are not burdened by the split.

### Continuity

Until RWF-0x is approved and receives its DAI budget within the 2-of-3 multisig, the current Facilitator of RWF-001 will continue to compensate Core Unit members @christiancdpetersen, @teej, and @eumenes as per the agreed upon MKR and DAI obligations. This will enable ongoing processing of the current and future pipeline of proposals. Further, until RWF-0x is approved and receives its budget allocation, @williamr will not make any additional modifications to the RWF-001 budget, included but not limited to returning DAI to the treasury.

As such, if RWF-0x is for any reason, not approved, RWF-001 will continue to operate as is, with all obligations to Core Unit members in MKR and DAI being respected.

### Monetalis (MIP65) and Liquidity Opportunities

During the interim period, @christiancdpetersen will support the implementation of Monetalis MIP65 and other strategic finance initiatives greenlit and/or approved by Maker token holders and be compensated through RWF-001. RWF-0x will assume such amounts as a deduction from its budget when the actual budget split occurs. @christiancdpetersen will maintain detailed time and other records to evidence such amounts.

After the formal split into RWF-001 and RWF-0x, @christiancdpetersen will provide support to the Strategic Finance Core Unit (SF-001) on various initiatives brought to the Maker token holders by SF-001. For such work, @christiancdpetersen’s time and any third-party legal expenses will be paid from the RWF-0x budget.
