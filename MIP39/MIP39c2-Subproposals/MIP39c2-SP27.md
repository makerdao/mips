MIP39c2-SP27 adds Core Unit SF-001: Strategic Finance Core Unit. Its mission is to provide financial reporting and analysis to assist the DAO in evaluating the financial health of the protocol to enable strategic decision making and allocate capital more effectively.

## Specification

### Motivation

I joined the DAO almost exactly a year ago, initially as an investor to learn more about the project and direction of the DAO. I was particularly interested in the RWF CU and after discussing my background with @amyjung, she recommended I connect with @SebVentures. As I continued to get more and more involved in the community and working with Seb, I saw tremendous opportunity to add value through building out the financial foundation Seb laid down.

The intellectual curiosity, openness, and desire of the DAO to create and grow a more robust, transparent, and secure financial system is deeply motivating. Adding in the mandate to fight the most challenging problem humanity has faced - climate change - and I could not be more excited to do everything I can to support the DAO and its mission.

### Core Unit Mandate

#### Mission

Provide financial reporting and analysis to assist the DAO in evaluating the financial health of the protocol to enable strategic decision making and allocate capital more effectively.

#### Vision

Our vision is to provide the most accurate and clear financial reporting across the entire crypto industry, leveraging the transparency and immutability of the public blockchain to ultimately provide financials data that exceeds the requirements of IFRS (International Financial Reporting Standards). Additionally, we seek to provide the DAO and MakerDAO stakeholders with relevant financial information to help assess the health of the protocol. We will accomplish this by:

- Providing clear, easily digestible financial information to the DAO that enables stakeholders to make informed decisions for the protocol
- Building financial dashboards and tools that provide real-time financial data directly from the blockchain so stakeholders can understand the health of the protocol
- Partnering with SES to implement standardized and automated expense reporting vs budgets
- Collaborating with Growth and Risk Core Units to provide financial analysis of prospective deals
- Working with the Protocol Engineering and Oracle Core Units to model growth opportunities and risks
- Asset-liability management and innovation through investing protocol assets to generate yield (real-world assets, DeFi, etc.)
- Facilitating recurring strategic reviews to set a strategic action plan and
- Accounting, solvency, liquidity, and potential regulatory reporting

### Strategy & Current Work

SF encompasses the traditional finance functions, including financial reporting, planning, analysis, and accounting, as well as an advisory component that helps facilitate consensus around the DAO's strategic priorities. This work, as detailed below and in the 'RWF Efforts' section, will be continued with the approval of the SF Core Unit. This work includes but is not limited to:

- Publishing Monthly Financial Statements
- Posting Monthly Financial Reports
- Reporting Actual Monthly Expenses & Forecasting by Core Unit
- Partnering with GRO-001 Facilitator @Nadia and RISK-001 Facilitator @Primoz to negotiate terms for the Nexo Institutional Vault as well as another 600M+ undisclosed prospective IV customer
- Maintenance of the Real-Time Financial Dashboard
- Forecasting Revenue and Profitability
- Analyzing Profitability by Vault
- Building new SQL queries to support the Strategic Focus Areas for the Recurring Strategy Reviews and KPIs

Our approach to working with the DAO is focused on collaboration. We believe partnering with the other Core Units and MKR holders, with each bringing our strengths and expertise to the table will yield multiplicative benefits compared to working purely in silos. This does not mean the Core Unit is dependent on other Core Units to execute the current work and envisioned scope; only that results will be maximized through collaboration. This collaboration is already happening today and will only get better moving forward.

### Roadmap

The SF CU will initially focus on continuing to build a solid financial reporting foundation and continue its work on the [RWF FP&A roadmap](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/rwf-financial-planning-analysis-roadmap/9756), prioritizing work based on community feedback.
