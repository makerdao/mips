## Sentence Summary

MIP39c?-SP# adds Core Unit MT-001: Maker Talent

## Paragraph Summary

MIP39c?-SP# adds Core Unit MT-001: Maker Talent is focused recruiting best-in-class talent for the Maker Protocol, targeted through innovative social recruiting practices and offering amazing candidate experience.


## Specification

### Motivation

As MakerDAO and its Core Unit grows, the need of connecting with IT professionals in the blockchain sector becomes an urgent need that has to be solved fast, but with a long term strategy.


Till now, many Core Units have been growing by using their own resources and network, but this strategy does not scale up. If we look at the upcoming challenges in adoption and the fight for the small number of professionals in the sector, the lack of recruitment help can compromise the success of many projects.

We strongly believe that creating an active community of talented professionals that remain positive about being a Maker contributor will ease the way onboard them when needed and will promote talent as a great place for a developer to start a career.

- The Core Unit Mandateis the broad scope of what problems the Core Unit must solve, and what must be operated and maintained for the Core Unit to contribute to the success of the project.
- The Core Unit Mandate should be specific enough to ensure that Maker Governance has clarity about what problems it is solving when delegating resources to the Core Unit.
- Beyond that, the Core Unit Mandate should be as broad as possible in order to leave room for Facilitators to implement a flexible approach to solve the problems as the environment change.
- The Core Unit Mandate can also contain directives, guidelines or suggestions from Governance that helps inform Facilitators and Contributors of the Core Unit how to act in certain situations.
