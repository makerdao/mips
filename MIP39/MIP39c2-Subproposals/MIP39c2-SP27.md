## Paragraph Summary

MIP39c2-SP#: 27 adds Core Unit MT-001: Maker Talent is focused in recruiting best-in-class talent for the Maker Protocol, targeted through innovative social recruiting practices and offering an amazing candidate experience.

## Specification

### Motivation: The Problem

As MakerDAO and its Core Unit grows, the need of connecting with IT professionals in the Blockchain becomes a critical matter that requires both urgent attention and a long term strategy.

Until now, Core Units have been growing by employing their own resources and personal network, but this strategy is limited as MakerDAO scales up. 

By observing the upcoming challenges for Maker in growth and adoption, and the struggle for finding talent within such a small niche, the lack of a recruitment strategy can compromise the success of MakerDAO.

We believe that a long term solution to this problem remains on developing and maintaining an active pool of blockchain professionals, that are enthusiastic about the Maker spirit and projects, so we can speed up and facilitate the process of onboarding them when needed.
