## Sentence Summary

Arrange, coordinate, and execute a Liquid Bond Strategy to replace part of the current Maker USDC exposure.

## Paragraph Summary

The MIP intends to accomplish the following over a short time frame:

* Set up a starting Liquid Bond Strategy to replace part of the Maker USDC funds
* Select a professional fund manager for the execution of the above strategy
* Set up a Maker Execution and Governance Operating platform necessary for implementation
* Implement and Deploy USDC [TBD]M
* Devise a staged plan for further deployment

#### *The progression through the above phases will be done with full community transparency, discussion, and approvals.*

## Component Summary

[TBD]

## Motivation

* USDC is a large single-asset exposure on Maker's balance sheet - and pays no yield.

* We believe that working with professional bond managers and starting a diversification strategy can, and should, be implemented ASAP. Remaining appropriately liquid and secure, but with non-correlated risk exposure and generating yield.

* From the many discussions and proposals on the Maker forum on this topic, we believe there is solid consensus in the Maker Community on the necessity and desirability of this course of action. What is now needed is someone to put it into detail and practice.

* Arranging, coordinating, and executing the above, in our view, lies within the purview of the intended Arranger role - and in this case, within our particular skill-set. We intend to act as the community’s “tip of the spear” turning the above thoughts into facts - quickly and efficiently.

* A secondary motivation is to further clarify the Arranger role in practice.

## Specification / Proposal Details of Project Clydesdale


### Monetalis Role

Before delving into the detail of the proposal, we need to clarify Monetalis role, so nobody gets the wrong idea:

* We will act as a facilitator/coordinator/project manager. We will be the practical hands ensuring a clear and paced progress of the community sentiments and choices into a practical executed solution.
* We are **NOT** setting the bond strategy, choosing the fund manager or the execution/governance platform. We will provide practical options for the community to review and choose from, and push it all towards an appropriate MKR vote.
* We will, of course, coordinate with all relevant CUs during the process.

We bridge the off-chain “Execution Gap” that sits between CUs analytical, review and recommendation powers and the Community/MKR Voting/decision-making powers.

### The Solution for Execution

*for continued update -*  **Version 0.0  /  6/2/2022**

This section will be filled out as the process progresses, the various pieces of the solution appear, and community consensus around them is achieved.

Here is a strawman solution - purely for example and reference:

|Dimension|Choice|Documentation & Reviews|
| --- | --- | --- |
|Deployment Amount|USD [TBD]|-|
|Fund Manager|X&X AM|-|
|Fund Strategy|-|-|
|Fund Agreement|-|-|
|Execution Platform|-|-|
|Execution Platform Agreements|-|-|
|Third-party Agreements|-|-|

### The Train Schedule

We have designed the process in overview as follows:

The detailed plan can be found in this spreadsheet: [ProjectClydesdalev1](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1yvwQ_NrJ5SiQmYHCw-9lMH7BQSoy4ZpeWaI4RIBg-Yc/edit?usp=sharing)

### Reporting & Transparency

This will be a transparent process. We will report on the project progress and the solution building on [this website](https://clydesdale.brick.do), for easy access. All relevant discussion subjects, reviews, etc will be posted on the forum under this MIP.

### “Train on time” ?

We would love to give the community tight timelines and a promise to get the train running on time. Unfortunately, as with all complex transactions, there is a multitude of third parties involved in the process, who are out of our control.

We will certainly drive the process towards the presented train schedule. We will make it very clear in the progress monitoring who/what is holding back the schedule and for how long. We believe this is the best way to encourage getting the train on time in this particular execution environment.

### Why Monetalis?

We have the skills. Designing, driving, and executing complex, multi-party transactions is the day-to-day job of any private equity executive.

We have designed the asset side of balance sheets for insurers in several countries, which were mainly bond strategies, and worked with external fund managers to co-design and execute these.

After the MIP21 process with Monetalis SME wholesale lending platform, we are now quite confident about what are the issues around Maker off-chain execution platforms and how to solve them in a comfortable way.

We know the CUs who can/should provide insights to the community through the process.

Lastly, we hope we have shown the right long-term Maker ecosystem partner attitudes: being transparent and open, presenting thought-out solutions and ideas, trying to add value in community discussions, and seeking consensus and compromise solutions.

### Budget/Compensation

We have decided, as we are here breaking new ground, to go into this process and deploy resources without any specific agreement on compensation or budget. We are confident a fair solution can be found and agreed upon throughout the project.
