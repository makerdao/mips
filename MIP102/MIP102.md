## Sentence Summary

MIP102 defines processes for the amendment and removal of accepted MIPs for the purposes of implementing the Endgame.

## Paragraph Summary

The Amendment and Removal Process-MIP outlines the process for arbitrary changes to MIPs, and removal of MIPs. It is empowered to make the changes that are required for the Maker Constitution to be properly integrated into Maker Governance.

## Component Summary

**MIP102c1: Purpose Description**  
Suggests the purpose of the amendment and removal processes and possible reasons for using each process.

**MIP102c2: Amendment Process for MIPs**  
A process component which defines a method and template for the amendment of an accepted MIP.

**MIP102c3: MIP Removal Process**  
A process component which defines a method and template for the removal of an accepted MIP.

## Motivation

For the implementation of Endgame, the Maker Constitution will take over most governance processes and functions, however some existing MIPs will be required to stay in place to make the transition easier and save work. This MIP provides the necessary rules to enable arbitrary changes to existing MIPs in order to make them compatible with the Maker Constitution.

## Specification / Proposal Details

### MIP102c1: Purpose Description

MIP Amendments that preserve the MIP number can be performed to modify any aspect of an existing MIP, including MIP0. There are no restrictions on how an existing MIP can be amended.

#### Removals

MIP102 also enables the removal of one or multiple MIPs that are inactive as a part of the Endgame transition.

Multiple MIPs may be removed in a single MIP Removal subproposal.
