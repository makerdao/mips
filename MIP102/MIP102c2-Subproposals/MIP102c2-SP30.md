## Specification

This MIP102c2 Subproposal does not seek to amend Article 1 of a Scope Bounded Mutable Alignment Artifact. It is thus considered a General Edit. An MIP102c2 General Edit cannot modify Article 1 elements.

### Motivation

Monetalis has not met its obligations as an Arranger, and its managed structures have underperformed financially. Governance should wind down the relationship to make room for a new Arranger.

### Amended MIPs and Components

MIP104

### Amendment Pull Request

### Summary of Changes

- Removes Monetalis as an active Arranger.
- Establishes a process to appoint a temporary Arranger.
- Establishes a requirement to hand over control of Arranged structures, and an offboarding payment at the conclusion of that hand over.
