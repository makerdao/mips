## Sentence Summary

This MIP defines a new Liquidation System for the Maker Protocol.

## Paragraph Summary

If accepted, this MIP would resolve some [inefficiencies](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/a-liquidation-system-redesign-a-pre-mip-discussion/2790) in the current liquidation system by replacing the current English style auction system, where bids start low, with a new Dutch style auction system, where auction prices generally start high and drop over time.  The key advantage to the new liquidation system is that the entire Vault's collateral is available at a given price.  As time passes, the DAI the protocol is willing to take for the collateral falls.  This allows keepers to leverage all liquidity available on-chain using single block composability.  The design is intended to reduce the risk that auctions clear at lower-than-market prices, while removing most liquidity constraints from keepers.  Liquidations 2.0 is also intended to reduce price volatility risk from keepers.

This document supersedes the [Liquidations 2.0: Technical Summary](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/liquidations-2-0-technical-summary/4632).

## Specification


### MIP45c1 Governance Parameters

#### `Abacus/LinearDecrease` -- **tau** [seconds]

Seconds after auction start when the price reaches zero.

#### `Abacus/StairstepExponentialDecrease` -- **cut** [ray]

Per-`step` multiplicative factor. Initialized to zero and should be set to a valid value before the contract is used to provide prices.
`cut = 0.99 * RAY` specifies a 1% drop every `step` seconds.

#### `Abacus/StairstepExponentialDecrease` -- **step** [seconds]

Length of time between price drops.

#### `Abacus/ExponentialDecrease` -- **cut** [ray]
Per-second multiplicative factor. Initialized to zero and should be set to a valid value before the contract is used to provide prices.
`cut = 0.99 * RAY` specifies a 1% drop every second.

#### `Clipper` -- **buf** [ray]

The multiplicative factor to increase the starting price of an auction.
E.g., if the current OSM price of an asset is 1,000 and `buf = 1.2 * RAY` (20% above), then the initial price of that auction will be 1,200.

#### `Clipper` -- **calc** [address]

The contract address of the price calculator function. Adheres to `Abacus` interface. Some examples of price functions are found in `abaci.sol` file.

#### `Clipper` -- **chip** [wad]

Percentage of `tab` to `suck` from `vow` to incentivize keepers when liquidating a vault or resetting an already existing auction.
`chip = 0.02 * WAD` is 2%.

#### `Clipper` -- **cusp** [ray]

Percentage price drop that can occur before an auction must be reset. Together with `tail`, this parameter determines when an auction needs to be reset.
E.g., if the initial price of an auction (`top`) is set to 1,200 and `cusp = 0.6 * RAY` (60% of the starting price), then the auction will need to be reset when reaching just below the price of 720.

#### `Clipper` -- **dog** [address]

The address of the liquidation module contract.

#### `Clipper` -- **spotter** [address]

The Collateral price module contract address.

#### `Clipper` -- **tail** [seconds]

Seconds that can elapse before an auction must be reset. Together with `cusp`, this parameter determines when an auction needs to be reset.
E.g., if `tail` is 1800 seconds, then if an auction is not complete after 30 minutes have elapsed, it will need to be reset.

#### `Clipper` -- **tip** [rad]

Flat fee to `suck` from `vow` to incentivize keepers when liquidating a vault or resetting an already existing auction.
`tip = 100 * RAD` is 100 DAI.

#### `Clipper` -- **vow** [address]

The address of the accounting system contract. The recipient of DAI raised in auctions.

#### `Dog` -- **Hole** [rad]

Max DAI needed to cover debt + liquidation penalty of active auctions.
`Hole = 10,000,000 * RAD` is 10M DAI.

#### `Dog` -- **ilk.chop** [wad]

Liquidation Penalty per collateral (`ilk`).
E.g., if there is a vault ready to be liquidated that has a debt of 1,000 DAI and `chop = 1.13 * WAD` (13% above), then the max amount to be raised by the auction will be 1,130 DAI.

#### `Dog` -- **ilk.clip** [address]

The address of the auction module contract. One `clip` per collateral (`ilk`).

#### `Dog` -- **ilk.hole** [rad]

Max DAI needed to cover debt + liquidation penalty of active auctions per collateral (`ilk`).
`hole = 10,000,000 * RAD` is 10M DAI.

#### `Dog` -- **vow** [address]

The address of the accounting system contract. The recipient of the bad debt coming from a vault when it's liquidated.

### MIP45c2 Vault Liquidation

[https://github.com/makerdao/dss/blob/liq-2.0/src/dog.sol](https://github.com/makerdao/dss/blob/liq-2.0/src/dog.sol)

#### The Vault liquidation function (`Dog.bark`) takes three caller supplied arguments:

- `ilk`: the collateral ilk
- `urn`: the Vault to be liquidated
- `kpr`: the address where DAI incentives will be sent

#### `Dog.bark` performs several actions:

- confiscates the given Vault `urn` if it's undercollateralized and
    - sends the collateral to the `ilk`'s `Clipper`
    - increments the `vow`'s bad debt accumulator
- pushes the bad debt into the debt queue
- adds the bad debt plus the liquidation penalty to the `Hole` with the `Dirt` accumulator
- adds the bad debt plus the liquidation penalty to the `ilk.hole` with the `ilk.dirt` accumulator
- initiates the auction by calling `Clipper.kick()`
- fires the `Bark()` event

In the context of the Maker protocol, a "liquidation" is the automatic transfer of collateral from an insufficiently collateralized Vault, along with the transfer of that Vault's debt to the protocol. In both the current liquidation contract (the `Cat`) and the 2.0 version (the `Dog`), an auction is started promptly to sell the transferred collateral for DAI in an attempt to cancel out the debt now assigned to the protocol. This makes the behavior of the new contract very similar to that of the current one, but there are some important differences, explained below.

### MIP45c3 Partial vs. Total Liquidations

In the current system, in each call to the liquidation function (`Cat.bite`) transfers a fixed amount of debt (the `dunk`) from the affected Vault, along with a proportional amount of the Vault's collateral to the protocol. For example, if 50% of a Vault's debt is taken by the protocol, then half of its collateral is taken as well. If the Vault's debt is less than the `dunk`, then all debt and collateral is taken. In 2.0, all debt is taken when the liquidation function (`Dog.bark`) is called, and no analogue of the `dunk` parameter exists. The reasoning behind this change is that because the new auctions allow partial purchases of collateral, the liquidity available to a participant no longer limits their ability to participate in auctions, so instead the total number of auctions should be minimized.  Just to emphasize, there is no longer a minimum DAI liquidity requirement for the sale of collateral on a per-participant basis.

### MIP45c4 Limits on DAI Needed to Cover Debt and Fees of Active Auctions

In situations involving large amounts of collateral at auction, the current and new designs modify the behavior described in the previous section. Both liquidations 1.2 and 2.0 implement a limit on the total amount of DAI needed to cover the summed debt and liquidation penalty associated with all active auctions.  In `LIQ-1.2` this is called the `box`, and in `LIQ-2.0` we call this the `Hole`.  Whenever the maximum possible addition to this value is less than the amount of debt+fees that would otherwise be sent to auction, a partial liquidation is performed so as not to exceed this amount. In the current system there is only a global limit; in 2.0, in addition to the global limit, there is also a per-collateral limit.  Similar to how there is an `ilk.line` for a collateral's debt ceiling and a `Line` for the overall system debt ceiling, there is now an `ilk.hole` to correspond with the `Hole`.  This ensures that typical market depth against DAI can be taken into account on a per-collateral basis by those determining risk parameters. The `Dirt` accumulator tracks the total DAI needed to cover the debt and penalty fees of all active auctions, and must be less than `Hole` for a call to `bark` to succeed. For each collateral type, `ilk.dirt` tracks the total DAI needed to cover the debt and penalty fees of a all active auctions for that `ilk`, and must be less than `ilk.hole` for a call to `bark` (on a Vault of that `ilk`) to succeed.

### MIP45c5 Auction Initiation

[https://github.com/makerdao/dss/blob/liq-2.0/src/clip.sol](https://github.com/makerdao/dss/blob/liq-2.0/src/clip.sol)

#### The auction initiation function (`Clipper.kick`) takes four caller supplied arguments:

- `tab`: the target DAI to raise from the auction (`debt` + `stability fees` + `liquidation penalty`) [rad]
- `lot`: the amount of collateral available for purchase [wad]
- `usr`: the address to return any excess collateral to
- `kpr`: the address where DAI incentives will be sent

#### `Clipper.kick` performs several checks and actions:

- checks that the caller is authorized (only the `Dog` or governance may call `Clipper.kick`)
- checks that liquidations are enabled in the four-stage circuit breaker
- increments a counter and assigns a unique numerical `id` to the new auction
- inserts the `id` into a list tracking active auctions
- creates a structure to record the parameters of the auction; this includes:
    - it's position in the active auctions list
    - the target amount of DAI to raise from bidders (`tab`)
    - the amount of collateral available for purchase (`lot`)
    - the Vault that was liquidated to create this auction
        - allows return of collateral if not all of it is sold
        - allows the return of collateral and `tab` when `Clipper.yank` is called by `End.snip`
    - the timestamp of the auctions creation (as a Unix epoch)
    - the initial price of collateral in the auction (`top`)
- sends an incentive denominated in DAI to the `kpr`
- fires the `Kick()` event

The initial price is set by reading the current price in the corresponding [Oracle Security Module](https://docs.makerdao.com/smart-contract-modules/oracle-module/oracle-security-module-osm-detailed-documentation) (OSM) and multiplying by a configurable percentage (the `buf` parameter). Note that the *current* OSM price is between one and two hours delayed relative to the actual market price.  A keeper doesn't make a call to `Clipper.kick` directly, but rather makes a call to `Dog.bark` which in turn calls `Clipper.kick`.

### MIP45c6 Liquidation Incentive Mechanism

In this design, there is less incentive to quickly liquidate Vaults than in the current system, because there is no inherent advantage obtained by doing so. In contrast, the current auction system grants the account triggering a liquidation the privilege of making the first bid in the resulting auction. It is unclear whether this matters significantly in practice, or whether some stronger incentive should be added (for example, a small DAI reward paid to liquidators).

To ensure there was a remedy for this potential issue, an incentive mechanism was added for liquidators. The form of the incentive is, on a per-collateral type basis, a constant amount of DAI plus an amount of DAI that scales linearly with the amount of debt associated with the liquidation. Either contribution can be set to zero. Such a structure is justified by the following:

- The reward is set per-collateral to give maximum flexibility to include not just per-collateral risk parameters like `mat` (collateralization ratio) and `chop` (liquidation penalty) in its setting, but also to allow for unique market conditions that might only apply to one or a few collateral types.
- The component of the reward that increases linearly with the total Vault debt is intended to be used to reward liquidators for reducing risk to the system, as risk itself scales with the size of undercollateralized Vaults—a Vault that is twice as big as another represents twice the risk of bad debt accrual. Or viewed another way, liquidating two vaults of size X represents the same risk reduction as liquidating one Vault of size 2X—thus the reward to a liquidator ought to be similar. Further, the system can *afford* to pay more for larger liquidations, because the liquidation penalty is also proportional to the amount of debt outstanding for a given Vault.
- The constant component of the reward can be used to cover gas costs (which are per-Vault for liquidators) or to allow MKR holders to effectively pay Keepers to clear small Vaults that would otherwise not be attractive for liquidation.

These parameters must be set extremely carefully, lest it be possible to exploit the system by "farming" liquidation rewards (e.g., creating Vaults with the intention of liquidating them and profiting from the too-high rewards). Generally, the liquidation reward should remain less than the minimum liquidation penalty by some margin of safety so that the system is unlikely to accrue a deficit. This doesn't necessarily prevent farming, it just helps ensure the system remains solvent. For example, incentives can be farmed in a capital-efficient way when `Dirt` is close to `Hole` or when `ilk.dirt` is close to `ilk.hole` for some collateral type. An attacker would purchase a small amount of collateral from a running auction, freeing up a small amount of room relative to either `Hole` or `ilk.hole`, then liquidate a small portion of an existing Vault to collect the reward, and repeat the process. This can be done over and over in the same transaction, and the activation of EIP 2929 (scheduled for the Berlin hard fork at the time of writing) will significantly reduce the associated gas costs (due to warm storage reads and writes). Note that since the attacker does not need to create their own Vaults, the size of the liquidation penalty in relation to the incentive value is not a deterrent; only gas costs matter to the attacker. The fact that the Dog prevents partial liquidations that remove less than `ilk.dust` debt from a Vault helps to mitigate this scenario--so long as the liquidation penalty exceeds the total reward for this minimal liquidation size, _and the liquidation penalty is reliably collected by the resulting auction_ (which may not hold under conditions of market or network perturbation), the system should not on balance accrue bad debt.

### MIP45c7 Four-Stage Liquidation Circuit Breaker

In this section, we'll cover the four stages of the liquidation circuit breaker. In contrast to `LIQ-1.2`, Liquidations 2.0 comes with a four-stage circuit breaker built into the `Clipper` contract. The stages are:

- **liquidations enabled**(`0`): This means the breaker is not tripped and the protocol can liquidate new Vaults as well as service old liquidations.
- **new liquidations disabled**(`1`): This means no new liquidations (`Clipper.kick`).
- **new liquidations and resets disabled**(`2`): This means no new liquidations (`Clipper.kick`), and auctions that have reached either a price or time endpoint cannot be reset (`Clipper.redo`).
- **liquidations disabled**(`3`): This means no new liquidations (`Clipper.kick`), no takes (`Clipper.take`), and no resets (`Clipper.redo`).

Just like in `LIQ-1.2`, the circuit breaker will be available through a `ClipperMom` contract giving governance the ability to bypass the `GSM` delay for circuit breaker actions.

### MIP45c8 Bidding (Purchasing)

[https://github.com/makerdao/dss/blob/liq-2.0/src/clip.sol](https://github.com/makerdao/dss/blob/liq-2.0/src/clip.sol)

#### The purchasing function (`Clipper.take`) takes five caller supplied arguments:

- `id`: the numerical id of the auction to bid on
- `amt`: the maximum amount of collateral to buy (`amt`) — a purchase behaves like a limit order [wad]
- `max`: the maximum acceptable price in DAI per unit collateral (`max`) [ray]
- `who`: address that will receive the collateral (`who`)
- `data`: an arbitrary bytestring (if provided, the address `who`, if it is neither the `Dog` nor `Vat` address stored by the Clipper, is called as a contract via an interface described below, to which this data is passed) [bytes]

#### `Clipper.take` performs several initial checks:

- a reentrancy check to ensure the function is not being recursively invoked
- that the four-stage circuit breaker is not tripped
- that the auction id corresponds to a valid auction
- that the auction does not need to be reset, either due to having experienced too large a percentage decrease in price, or having existed for too long of a time duration
- that the caller's specified maximum price is at least the current auction price

Then, the amount of collateral to attempt to purchase is computed as the minimum of the collateral left in the auction (`lot`) and the caller's specified quantity (`amt`)—the resulting value is the `slice`. This value is then multiplied by the current price of the auction to compute the DAI owed in exchange (`owe`). If `owe` exceeds the DAI collection target of the auction (`tab`), then `owe` is adjusted to be equal to `tab`, and `slice` is set to `tab / price` (i.e., the auction will not sell more collateral than is needed to cover debt+fees from the liquidated Vault).

To make it less likely that auctions are left in a state that is unattractive to bid on, further logic is applied if there will be both left over DAI target and collateral based on the initial determinations for `slice` and `owe`. If the remaining `tab` in such a case would be less than `chost` (a value stored by the contract, asynchronously set to `ilk.dust * ilk.chop / WAD` by the `upchost()` function), then:
1) If the overall DAI target is less than `chost`, **the function reverts. Callers should be aware of this possibility and account for it when necessary.**
2) Otherwise, `owe` is set to `tab - chost`, and `slice` is set to `(tab - chost) / price`.

This heuristic for preventing a too-small remaining collateral amount and/or DAI target is imperfect and may fail in some situations; if this occurs, there is no serious harm to the protocol; the auction will simply remain uncompleted. However, governance may wish to fully clear such "lost" auctions via `take` or `yank` to avoid cluttering the list of active auctions each `Clipper` maintains, which could impair the performance of DEX and aggregator integrations (and possibly off-chain bots too, depending on how they are written).

Next, collateral is transferred (within the protocol's [accounting module](https://docs.makerdao.com/smart-contract-modules/core-module/vat-detailed-documentation)) to the `who` address provided by the caller. If the caller provided a bytestring with greater than zero length, an external call is made to the `who` address, assuming it exposes a function, follow Solidity conventions, with the following signature:

```jsx
clipperCall(
    address,            // recipient of DAI
    uint256,            // owe   [rad]
    uint256,            // slice [wad]
    bytes calldata
)
```

The first argument is the recipient of DAI.  That is, this is the address the `clipperCallee` must return DAI to.  The second argument is DAI owed (as a 45 decimal digit fixed-precision integer, or `rad`), the third argument is the collateral being purchased (as an 18 decimal digit fixed-precision integer, or `wad`), regardless of the precision of the external token contract, and the last argument is identical to what bytestring the caller originally supplied to the purchase function. As mentioned earlier, a locking mechanism prevents reentry into the purchase function during this external call, and the `Clipper.redo` call, for security reasons. Example implementations of the `ClipperCallee` interface can be found in the [exchange-callees](https://github.com/makerdao/exchange-callees) repository.

After the external call completes (or immediately following the transfer of collateral, if no external call was executed), DAI is transferred (internally, within the core [accounting module](https://docs.makerdao.com/smart-contract-modules/core-module/vat-detailed-documentation)) from `msg.sender` to the protocol.

Lastly, various values are updated to record the changed state of the auction: the DAI needed to cover debt and fees for outstanding auctions, and outstanding auctions of the given collateral type, are reduced (via a callback to the liquidator contract) is reduced by `owe`, and the `tab` (DAI collection target) and `lot` (collateral for sale) of the auction are adjusted as well. If all collateral has been drained from an auction, all its data is cleared and it is removed from the active auctions list. If collateral remains, but the DAI collection target has been reached, the same is done and excess collateral is returned to the liquidated Vault.

### MIP45c9 Example Liquidation

![](https://i.imgur.com/BgOFMyZ.gif)
**Figure MIP45c9.1**: NOTE: in the above figure, `tau` is `tail`.

In this example we can see a linear decrease function (`calc`), with an `ETH-A` OSM price of **200 DAI**, a `buf` of **20%**, a `tail (tau)` of **21600** seconds, a `tab` of ***60,000 DAI** with a `lot` of `347.32` ETH.  There are two bidders, **Alice** and **Bob**.  **Alice** calls `take` first and is willing to give ***50,000 DAI** in return for **256.41** ETH collateral, a price of **195 DAI** per ETH.  The price of ETH continues to fall over time, and **Bob** picks up the remaining **90.91** ETH for **10,000 DAI**, a price of **110 DAI** per ETH.  If more than `tail` seconds have elapsed since the start of the auction, or if the price has fallen to less than `cusp` percent of `top`, then `Clipper.take` would revert if called, and the auction would need to be reset with a `Clipper.redo` call.

### MIP45c10 Features

As discussed previously, collateral auctions are being changed from English to Dutch style. The current auction functionality is described in the official Maker documentation; here, we will focus on the new Dutch design, and only reference some contrasting points relative to the current design.

### MIP45c11 Instant Settlement

Unlike the current English auctions, in which DAI bids are placed, with a participant's capital remaining locked until they are outbid or until the auction terminates, Dutch auctions settle instantly. They do so according to a price calculated from the initial price and the time elapsed since the auction began. Price versus time curves are discussed more later. The lack of a lock-up period mitigates much of the price volatility risk for auction participants and allows for faster capital recycling.

### MIP45c12 Flash Lending of Collateral

This feature, enabled by instant settlement, eliminates any capital requirement for bidders (excepting gas)—in the sense that even a participant with zero DAI (and nothing to trade for DAI) could still purchase from an auction by directing the sale of the auction's collateral into other protocols in exchange for DAI. Thus, all DAI liquidity available across DeFi can be used by any participant to purchase collateral, subject only to gas requirements. The exact mechanics are discussed above, but essentially a participant needs to specify a contract `who` (which conforms to a particular interface), and `calldata` to supply to it, and the auction contract will automatically invoke whatever logic is in the external contract.

### MIP45c13 Price as a Function of Time

[https://github.com/makerdao/dss/blob/liq-2.0/src/abaci.sol](https://github.com/makerdao/dss/blob/liq-2.0/src/abaci.sol)

Price-versus-time curves are specified through an interface that treats price at the current time as a function of the initial price of an auction and the time at which that price was set. How to determine the most effective price curve for a given collateral is still an active area of research; some initial options (linear, step-wise exponential, and continuous exponential) have been implemented for research purposes and initial deployment. Other candidates besides these include a piecewise linear curve and a piecewise exponential curve. This module is configurable and can be replaced in the course of innovation.

It is important for bidders to take into account that while the price almost always decreases with time, there are infrequent occasions on which the price of an active auction may increase, and this could potentially result in collateral being purchased at a higher price than intended. The most obvious event that would increase the price in a running auction is if that auction is reset (via `redo`), but changes to the configurable parameters of a price decrease calculator (or even the switching out of one calculator for another) by governance can also increase the price. It is recommended that bidders (or bidding UIs that abstract this detail away from the user) choose the maximum acceptable price (`max`) argument to `take` carefully to ensure a desirable outcome if the price should unexpectedly increase.

### MIP45c14 Resetting an Auction

As mentioned above, auctions can reach a defunct state that requires resetting for two reasons:

- too much time has elapsed since the auction started (controlled by the `tail` governance parameter)
- the ratio of the current price to the initial price has fallen below a certain level (specified by the `cusp` governance parameter).

The reset function, when called, first ensures that at least one of these conditions holds. Then it adjusts the starting time of the auction to the current time, and sets the starting price in exactly the same way as is done in the initialization function (i.e., the current OSM price increased percentage-wise by the `buf` parameter). This process will repeat until all collateral has been sold or the whole debt has been collected (unless the auction is canceled via `yank`, e.g., during Emergency Shutdown); contrast this behavior with the current auctions, which reset until at least one bid is received.

### MIP45c15 Improved Keeper Wallet Security

If keepers decide to use the `clipperCallee` pattern, then they need not store DAI or collateral on that account.  This means a keeper need only hold enough ETH to execute transactions that can orchestrate the `Clipper.take` call, sending collateral to a contract that returns DAI to the `msg.sender` to pay for the collateral all in one transaction.  The contract implementing the `clipperCallee` interface can send any remaining collateral or DAI beyond `owe` to a cold wallet address inaccessible to the keeper. **NOTE: If the keeper chooses to behave as an EOA address, then the DAI and collateral would be exposed just as in `LIQ-1.2` unless special care is taken to create a proxy contract.**

### MIP45c16 Incentive to call `redo()`

[https://github.com/makerdao/dss/blob/liq-2.0/src/clip.sol](https://github.com/makerdao/dss/blob/liq-2.0/src/clip.sol)

#### The auction initiation function (`Clipper.redo`) takes two caller supplied arguments:

- `id`: the current auction id
- `kpr`: the address where DAI incentives will be sent

#### `Clipper.redo` performs several checks and actions:

- a reentrancy check to ensure the function is not being recursively invoked
- that the four-stage circuit breaker is not tripped
- that the auction id corresponds to a valid auction
- that the auction needs to be reset, either due to having experienced too large a percentage decrease in price, or having existed for too long of a time duration
- updates several fields of the existing auction
    - `tic` to reset the auction start time
    - `top` with the current OSM price and `buf` percent
- `vat.suck`s DAI to the `kpr` as an incentive if eligible
- fires the `Redo()` event

An auction that has expired or which is currently offered at a value higher than the oracle threshold will likely not complete at favorable values. The system therefore provides a direct incentive to `Clipper.redo` the auction, resetting it's expiration and setting the starting price to match the current oracle price + buf. The redo includes the same Dai incentive to the keeper as the `Clipper.kick`, which is based on the flat fee plus the governance-defined percentage of collateral.  There is one exception to this incentive.  If the `tab` or `lot * price` remaining is under the `Clipper.chost` limit, then there will be no incentive paid to `redo` the auction.  This is to help prevent incentive farming attacks where no keepers bid on dusty lots, and `Clipper.redo` is called repeatedly.  If auctions in this state build up, governance may choose to pay a keeper to clean them up.

### MIP45c17 Shutdown (Global Settlement, Emergency Shutdown)

[https://github.com/makerdao/dss/blob/liq-2.0/src/end.sol](https://github.com/makerdao/dss/blob/liq-2.0/src/end.sol)

A started auction can be reverted via the `auth` function called `yank` in `Clipper` contract.
This function requires that the auction exists and executes the following actions:
- calls `dog.digs` in order to decrease its `Dirt` and `ilk.dirt` values by the remaining auction `tab`
- sends the remaining collateral to its `msg.sender`
- removes the auction struct data
- fires the `Yank()` event

This function might be thought of as a general purpose operation to migrate existing auctions to a new contract; however, the only use-case now is in the `End` module, which takes care of system shutdown.

The `End` module will be upgraded together with the auction contracts as a new function `End.snip` is required.

This function `End.snip` is responsible for calling `Clipper.yank` for any running auction when shutdown is triggered.  It will receive the collateral from `Clipper.yank` and will send it back to the vault owner together with the remaining debt to recover.  One consideration to note is that the debt that the vault owner will receive includes the liquidation penalty part already charged.

Getter for the `chop` value of a given `ilk`. `chop` has wad precision.

```
function bark(bytes32 ilk, address urn, address kpr)
    external returns (uint256 id);
```
The main liquidation function. Initiates an auction. A keeper calls this function to begin the auction of `urn` for a particular `ilk`. `kpr` is the address where the keeper incentive is sent, allowing keepers to have liquidation rewards sent to a different address than the caller.

```
function digs(bytes32 ilk, uint256 rad) external;
```
(Authenticated) Removes collateral from the accumulator. Called by the `Clipper`. The `rad` argument has rad precision.

```
function cage() external;
```
(Authenticated) Deactivates the `Dog` and sets `live` to 0.

function rely(address) external;
function deny(address) external;
```

Standard MakerDAO authorization structure.

```
function ilk() external view returns (bytes32);
```
The ilk that this Clipper is associated with.

```

```
Getters for governance-configured auction parameters.

```
function chost() external view returns (uint256);  // rad
```
Getter for the stored product of `Vat.ilk.dust` and `Dog.ilk.chop`. This value is used as a heuristic for whether a partial purchase will leave an auction with too little collateral and whether incentives should be given out when `redo` is called.

```
function kicks() external view returns (uint256);
```
Auction counter. Increments each time an auction is initiated.
```
function active(uint256 pos) external view returns (uint256);
```
Returns the id of the auction at index `pos` in the list of active auctions.
```
function sales(uint256) external view returns (
        uint256 pos,
        uint256 tab,   // rad
        uint256 lot,   // wad
        address usr,
        uint96  tic,   // Unix epoch
        uint256 top);  // ray
```
Returns information on a particular auction. Completed auctions are removed from the mapping.
```
function stopped() external view returns (uint256);
```
Returns the current circuit breaker status. `0` for all functions allowed, `1` if `kick` cannot be called, `2` if `kick` and `redo` cannot be called, and `3` if `kick`, `redo` and `take` cannot be called.
```
function file(bytes32 what, address data) external;
function file(bytes32 what, uint256 data) external;
```
(Authenticated) Parameter modification functions, available to governance. Numeric arguments should match the precision of the parameter being set.

```
function kick(uint256 tab, uint256 lot, address usr, address kpr)
    external returns (uint256 id);
```
(Authenticated) Initiates the auction. Called by the `Dog`. `tab` is rad-precion, `lot` is wad-precision.

```
function redo(uint256 id, address kpr) external;
```
Called to reset an auction due to expiry or price deviation.
```
function take(
    uint256 id,
    uint256 amt,  // wad
    uint256 max,  // ray
    address who,
    bytes calldata data) external;
```
Called to purchase collateral.

```
function list() external view returns (uint256[] memory);
function count() external view returns (uint256);
```
Helpers for iterating the list of active auctions. Use `list()` to get the unsorted array of auctions. Get the number of active auctions with `count()`. The function `active(uint256 pos)` (see above) can be used to access individual entries without needing to call `list()`.
```
function getStatus(uint256 id) external view returns (bool needsRedo, uint256 price);
```
Returns a bool if the auction is eligible for redo and the current price.
```
function upchost() external;
```
Updates the `chost` value stored in the contract to equal the product of `Vat.ilk.dust` and `Dog.ilk.chop` (the precision of the final value is rad). This allows `take` and `redo` to obtain `chost` with a single `SLOAD` (reading `dust` from the `Vat` requires 5 `SLOAD` operations due to how the API is structured, and reading `chop` is an additional `SLOAD`).
```
function yank(uint256 id) external;
```
(Authenticated) Allows an auction to be removed during Emergency Shutdown or via a governance action.

#### Known Risks

This section covers some of the known risks with Liquidations 2.0

### MIP45c19 Incentive Farming

Periodically, governance may increase the `ilk.dust` amount.  When this happens, it's usually because gas has become so expensive it impacts the efficiency of liquidations.  That is, the cost of calling `Dog.bark()`, `Clipper.take()`, or `Clipper.redo()` may exceed the collateral offered.  Incentives may be used as a remedy to this potential issue and possibly a way for the protocol to keep `ilk.dust` lower; however, governance must take care when increasing the `ilk`s `dust`, `tip`, or `chip` not to incentivize the creation of many Vaults to farm this incentive.  An example of an exploit is as follows:

1. governance decides to increment `dust` by **1500 DAI** at the same time they scale `ilk.tip` to subsidize auctions.
2. an attacker realizes it would be profitable between gas and the `chop` to shard (`fork`) their existing Vault into many Vaults or create many new Vaults.
3. the spell is voted on and passed
4. using one transaction the attacker puts their Vaults at the edge of unsafe, `poke()`s the OSM when next price is going down, then calls `Dog.bark()` on all their Vaults to collect the incentive.
5. Using the gains, they can also slightly overbid for their Vaults auctions.

In order to thwart this attack governance must be careful when setting `ilk.tip` and `ilk.chip` so as not to create this perverse incentive.

### MIP45c20 Price Decreases Too Quickly

If the price decreases too quickly it can have the following consequences:

- the auction ends without any bid, then it needs to be reset and possibly this will keep happening
- bidders end up having reverts due the auction ended before tx confirmation
- bidders end up paying much less than what they were willing to pay (possibly generating permanent bad debt)

### MIP45c21 Price Decreases Too Slowly

If the price decreases too slowly it can have the following consequences:

- auction price never catches up with the market price, eventually being reset
    - After the reset the price catches up, but is less than an optimal market price
    - After the reset the price catches up, but still leaves bad debt
    - After the reset the auction price still might not catch up, causing more resets and very likely leaving bad debt

### MIP45c22 Front-Running

In `LIQ-1.2` there is limited front-running risk as it requires capital to participate in auctions; however, in liquidations 2.0 if a keeper chooses to participate with no capital, there is substantial front-running risk from generalized front-running bots.  The easier it is to replace the `from` address of the transaction with one's own, the greater the risk.  To mitigate this risk keepers are encouraged to used authorized proxy contracts to interact with liquidations 2.0 and provide some amount of their own capital when bidding.  More aggressive gas prices may also work.  Unfortunately, we found no great way to prevent generalized front-running that preserves single-block composability.

### MIP45c23 OSM Risk for Start Price

Because `Clipper.kick` and `Clipper.redo` consult the OSM for the collateral price, auction settlement prices are very sensitive to an oracle attack. This is primarily mitigated by the one-hour OSM price delay, `Dog.Hole`, and `ilk.hole`. The fact that the price is delayed by one hour, however, presents a risk of its own: since the price is out-of-date relative to the market, it may be either too high or too low to allow for efficient settlement given other parameters like `buf` and the price decrease function. The consequences of either case are effectively covered by the sections on the risk of the price decreasing either too quickly or too slowly.

### MIP45c24 Setting Hole or ilk.hole Too High

While `Dog.Hole` and `ilk.hole` can be set much higher in liquidations 2.0, there are still risks to setting this too high.  A value for `Dog.Hole` that's set too high could result in far too much DAI demand, breaking the peg high.  This is somewhat mitigated by the PSM and stablecoin collateral types, but should still factor in to how this parameter is set.  An `ilk.hole` that is set too high, may have the additional result of causing a downward spiral as the liquidations push the asset price lower.  In addition, if there is an oracle attack, this parameter can be thought of as our maximum exposure.

### MIP45c25 Setting Hole or ilk.hole Too Low

If we set either `Dog.Hole` or `ilk.hole` too low, we run the risk of not being able to liquidate enough collateral at once.  This could lead to a buildup of undercollateralized positions in the system, eventually causing the accrual of bad debt.

#### Auction Parameter Changes Affect Running Auctions

Parameters, e.g., `tail`, `cusp`, or the price decrease function or any of its parameters, can be changed at any time by governance and will affect the behavior of running auctions. Integrators should take this possibility into account, reasoning through how sudden changes in parameters would impact their bidding strategies. Governance should endeavor to change parameters infrequently and if possible, only when there are not any auctions that will be affected.

## Invariants

These invariants have not yet been formally proven, and thus should only be considered intended behavior for now.

### MIP45c26 `Dog` Invariants

```
sum_over_all_ilks(Dog.ilk.dirt) == Dog.Dirt                             (c26.1)
```

### MIP45c27 `Clipper` Invariants

```
sum_over_auction_ids(Clipper.sales[id].lot) <= Vat.gem(Clipper)         (c27.1)
```

The above is an inequality (and not an _equality_) because it is impossible to prevent a user or contract from choosing to send collateral to a `Clipper`, even though it only makes sense for the `Dog` to do so. Governance (or a new module) could create a violation of this property by calling `kick` without transferring appropriate collateral to the `Clipper`. Thus this is actually a pseudo-invariant that only holds if callers of `kick` respect the requirement to send collateral to the `Clipper`, but it should hold for the live system if deployment and authorization is done correctly. It should hold if only active auctions are summed over as well.

### MIP45c28 Invariants involving quantities from both the `Dog` and `Clipper

```
sum_over_auctions_ids_and_ilks(Dog.ilk.clip.sales[id].tab) == Dog.Dirt  (c28.1)
```

The above should hold if only active auctions are summed over as well.

```
sum_over_auctions_ids(Dog.ilk.clip.sales[id].tab) == Dog.ilk.dirt       (c28.2)
```

The above should hold if only active auctions are summed over as well.

Note that (c28.1) and (c28.2) together imply (c26.1).
