## Specification

### Motivation

Today, the Domain Greenlight (MIP8) process occurs before the Community Greenlight Poll (MIP). This workflow increases the work required from Domain teams and reduces the time they can spend on doing domain work for onboarding collateral assets.

Therefore, this amendment MIP is proposing that the Domain Greenlight process (MIP8) should occur after the proposed collateral asset has passed the MIP9 Community Greenlight Poll allowing the Domain teams to use the Community Greenlight Poll results to make a more informed decision and proceed with their domain work. 

In summary, the amendments in this proposal affect the overall Collateral Onboarding MIPs Set and the previously ratified collateral onboarding process. More specifically, it rearanges the collateral onboarding process to allow MIP9 to occur before MIP8.
