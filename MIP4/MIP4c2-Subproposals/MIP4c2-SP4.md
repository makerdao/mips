## Specification

### Motivation

This amendment MIP proposes a change to MIP12 to allow the collateral onboarding process to operate more efficiently. More specifically, it states that collateral onboarding can continue to operate despite not having an official General Risk Model ratified through the MIP11 process. 

This amendment MIP specifically impacts MIP12 subproposals. The update will allow MIP12 subproposals to be proposed to the governance cycle without needing a General Risk Model officially ratified in order for risk domain teams to provide risk constructs for the greenlit collateral assets.

### Amended Components

- **Paragraph Summary**
    - Updated to reflect all of the domain teams involved in the collateral onboarding process. 

- **Component Summary**

More specifically, changing the risk team's requirements to allow MIP12 subproposals to be proposed to the governance cycle without needing a General Risk Model officially ratified in order to provide risk constructs for collateral assets (note that this holds true until a second, non-Foundation domain risk team has been ratified through the MIP7 process).
