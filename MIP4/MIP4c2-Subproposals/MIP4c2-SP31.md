## Specification

### Motivation

After successful trial run of the beta version of MIP63, there are a few learnings that I want to incorporate for the next iteration. Specifically, more strictly defining how payments are sent and buffers reported as well as changing a few parameters. The Sequencer can also set custom windows per network now.

### Amended MIPs and Components

This MIP4c2 subproposal revises [MIP63](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP63).
