## Specification

### Motivation

After successful trial run of the beta version of MIP63, there are a few learnings that I want to incorporate for the next iteration. Specifically, more strictly defining how payments are sent and buffers reported as well as changing a few parameters. Iâ€™ve also added an explicit stream duration as previously this was just assumed to be 6 months. The Sequencer can also set custom windows per network now.

### Amended MIPs and Components
