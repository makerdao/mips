## Specification

### Motivation

This amendment MIP proposes changes to MIP9.

The monthly poll date means that in some scenarios, a collateral asset must wait up to 6 weeks for inclusion in the community greenlight poll since its MIP6 application. This amendment seeks to make such scenarios impossible by introducing a second poll date on the 1st Monday of each month, in addition to the 3rd Monday, thus ensuring the polls take place bi-monthly. The 14-day discussion and voting period is maintained.
