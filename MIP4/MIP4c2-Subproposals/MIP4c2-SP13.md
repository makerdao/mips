## Sentence Summary

MIP4c2-SP13 amends MIP0 to be more precise in regards to the management of MIP Sets.

## Specification

### Motivation

As it stands, MIP Sets are only allotted a definition in MIP0c1. This definition ---a state of affairs, the circumstance of having MIPs that are tightly interwoven--- is strictly correct. Procedural indications as to how to handle this state of affairs, however, are nowhere to be found. This Amendment Subproposal aims to correct this lack by adding a component `MIPc14: MIP Set Management` that defines:

- A procedure for tagging MIP Sets
- Roles involved and their responsibilities

This component also contains some general considerations that should be kept in mind when dealing with MIP Sets.

Changes to MIP0 are minimal. Replacing the document instead of amending it is not warranted.

These changes have no impact on any other MIP.
