## Specification

This amendment MIP proposes to eliminate any reference to a facilitator as "individual" and replace it by the term  "authorized accounts".

### Motivation

MIP41 defines Facilitators as "accountable individuals".  The term individual is defined as "a single human being as contrasted with a social group or institution" (Merriam Webster Dictionary). This potentially limits participants from engaging as facilitators should they want to apply specifically as a liability protected entity.

By expanding the definition to "authorized accounts," entities will be able to apply as facilitator while specifying accounts that can engage in Maker Governance with the full power of the facilitator, while still retaining the consent of MKR holders. 

Rather than replacing the Facilitator MIP set, this amendment would allow groups such as LLCs apply to be Facilitators of Core Units with minimum disruption to the current governance process. 

Governance Facilitators will benefit from still having clear instructions from the DAO on who to listen to, without eroding the importance of the facilitator position.
