## Specification

### Motivation

This subproposal amends [MIP62c2](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP62#MIP62c2) and [MIP62c3](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP62#MIP62c3) to reflect the offboarding of the Content Production Core Unit (MKT-001) that occurred with the passage of [MIP41c5-SP3](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP41c5SP3) and [MIP40c3-SP49](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP40c3SP49).

This entails minor changes to a previously accepted MIP that reflect the offboarding of the Content Production Core Unit rather than any substantial change to MIP62---consequently, it is appropriate for an amendment under MIP4c3.

### Amended Components

- [MIP62c2](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP62#MIP62c2)

The following text will be removed from MIP62c2:

>"Content Production (MKT-001) publishes the associated notices to:
>
>* Official MakerDAO Blogs
>* Owned MakerDAO Twitter Accounts"

- [MIP62c3](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP62#MIP62c3)

MIP62c3 currently states:

> "New communication channels and media assets may be added to those listed under MIP62c2 without the requirement for governance vote by a joint public statement on the MakerDAO Forum to that effect by any two Core Unit facilitators, or by public statement on the MakerDAO Forum by a facilitator of GovComms (COM-001) or Content Production (MKT-001)."

This proposal would remove the reference to Content Production with the new wording as follows:

> "New communication channels and media assets may be added to those listed under MIP62c2 without the requirement for governance vote by a joint public statement on the MakerDAO Forum to that effect by any two Core Unit facilitators, or by public statement on the MakerDAO Forum by a facilitator of GovComms (COM-001)."
