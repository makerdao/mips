## Specification

### Motivation

During Feb 2022, we had two bug submissions for web vulns that were troublesome to categorize (post-mortems coming soon). A month later, bounties for these bugs are still being negotiated. A great deal of time was spent trying to find resolutions that seemed fair to both sides, for the whitehats and DUX. The change here would give more discretion to IS-001 to determine the bug bounty scope. This will allow us to refine the rules to reduce gray areas and potential disagreements.
