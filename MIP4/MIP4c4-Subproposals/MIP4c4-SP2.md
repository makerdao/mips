### Motivation

In an effort to simplify the growing body of DAO governance processes and policies, this subproposal repeals MIP14 in its entirety due to obsolescence.

Originally passed in October of 2020, MIP14 outlines a generic procedure for DAI to be sent from the protocol to an Ethereum address. It does not appear to have ever been utilized, and the transfer of DAI for a number of purposes has typically been authorized through whatever governance action authorizes the activity financed by that transfer.

Additionally, any subproposal under MIP14 would require a 4-week feedback period for sums between 10,000 and 100,000 DAI, and a 12-week feedback period for sums above 100,000 DAI. These thresholds make MIP14 impractical to use, but with no clear need for this MIP, repeal is favored over amendment.

### Removed MIPs
