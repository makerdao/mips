## Sentence Summary

To address concerns about liquidity for bank loan participations from HVBank ([MIP6](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/mip6-huntingdon-valley-bank-loan-syndication-collateral-onboarding-application/14219)) and Cogent Bank ([MIP95](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/mip95-100m-of-cogent-bank-loan-participations/19338)), I propose that RWA Master Participation Trust ("MakerTrustDE") sign up for [LoanStreet](https://loan-street.com/about/) ("LIQUIDATOR"), a platform for liquidating bank loans and viewing comparable sales (data Maker can use to mark-to-market loans in RWA Master Participation Trust).

## Paragraph Summary

[LoanStreet](https://loan-street.com/about/) ("LIQUIDATOR") is an online platform that streamlines the process of loan trading for banks. 1,300 institutions are registered on LoanStreet's platform, which trades a significant dollar volume of loans per month. LoanStreet utilizes a single agreement across all trades that significantly reduces time spent negotiating contracts, allowing deals to close quickly. We propose that RWA Master Participation Trust sign up for LoanStreet ("LIQUIDATOR") so that it can liquidate loans quickly if MRK voters want that. Moreover, with access to LoanStreet, RWA Master Participation Trust can view comparable sales data that is useful for mark-to-market of Maker's loan assets.

## Motivation

Response to MIP95 has been supportive but most have pointed to the fact that Maker's current meta includes a prioritization of daily liquidity for RWA. Putting aside my question about why monthly liquidity is not sufficient, I've posted this MIP as a solution to increase liquidity for the loan assets in RWA Master Participation Trust. I believe that bank loan participations should be part of a diversified portfolio of RWA, and that these loan assets have a liquid market, as evidenced by LoanStreet's robust business.

## Specification / Proposal Details

### MIP117c1: About Loan Street ("LIQUIDATOR")

The secondary market for bank originated loans is hundreds of $Millions, if not $Billions, per month. One player in this enormous market is [LoanStreet](https://loan-street.com/about/) ("LIQUIDATOR"), an online platform that streamlines the process of loan trading for banks. 1,300 institutions are registered on LoanStreet's platform, which trades a significant dollar volume of loans. LoanStreet utilizes a single agreement across all trades that significantly reduces time spent negotiating contracts, allowing deals to close quickly.

### MIP117c2: LoanStreet's Fee

LoanStreet charges the seller 15 bps (0.15%) of sales proceeds and 10 bps annually for reporting, though the reporting 10 bps are likely to be bourn by the originator of the loan not Maker.

### MIP117c3: Sign Up For Loan Street ("LIQUIDATOR")

This MIP instructs the Trustee and Trust Sponsor of the RWA Master Participation Trust (and any other relevant parties) to sign the Trust up for LoanStreet. There is zero cost to sign up.

### MIP117c4: If Necessary, Update the Trust Agreement

If a change to the Trust Agreement is necessary for the Trust to use LoanStreet as LIQUIDATOR, MKR voters authorize such an update to the RWA Master Participation Trust Agreement.

### MIP117c5: Use LoanStreet Data to Mark-to-Market Loan Assets

Once the RWA Master Participation Trust has signed up for LoanStreet, the Trustee will have access to loan sales data. This data should be made available to relevant service providers, such as Ankura Trust, any RWA monitoring team/solution that is operating at that time, and to whatever core units or MetaDAOs have an RWA mandate. 

This market data is useful for marking loan assets in the Trust to market. Furthermore, the data can be useful if the DAO wants to build automated liquidation for RWA based on mark-to-market values.
