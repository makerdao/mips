## MIP105c1: Preamble

The Real-World Asset Collateral Scope Framework defines the principles and processes related to the practical implementation of Real-World Asset Collateral allocation including direct exposure by Maker Core to stablecoins, and, during the pregame, direct exposure to advanced RWA collateral types including offchain and onchain bond products and complex loans. The Real-World Asset Collateral Scope Framework is subordinate the Stability and Liquidity Scope and the Physical Resilience Scope.

## 1: The Real-World Asset Collateral Advisory Council

#### 1.1: The Real-World Asset Collateral Advisory Council definition

The Real-World Asset Collateral Advisory Council is a group of Ecosystem Actors that have been approved by Maker Governance to carry out advisory work related to improving the content of the Real-World Asset Collateral Scope Framework.

#### 1.2: Real-World Asset Collateral Advisory Council membership management

Members of the Advisory Council are directly approved by Maker Governance through a governance poll, and must fulfill specific criteria.

* **1.2.1:** The Responsible Facilitators must ensure that potential Advisory Council Members can apply to be approved by Maker Governance, using an open process with clear instructions.

---

* **1.2.2:** Advisory Council Members must be ecosystem actors that are not involved in any business activity that could result in a conflict of interest, either directly or indirectly. They must also have relevant skills for providing professional expert input on the content that the Real-World Asset Collateral Scope is covering.

---

* **1.2.3:** The Responsible Facilitators must periodically, when it is relevant, review the Advisory Council Applications, and if they find applications that are suitable, bring them to a vote through an MKR governance poll. Approved Advisory Council Members are added to **10.2.3.1:**.

---

* **1.2.4:** The Responsible Facilitators may, if they deem it necessary, hold a vote to remove an Advisory Council Member. If an Advisory Council Member has not done any paid work for the Scope for at least 1 year, then the Responsible Facilitators can choose to remove them at will, if they deem it necessary.

---

* **1.2.5:** The current approved Avisory Council Members are recorded in the soft element **1.2.5.1**.

#### 1.3: Real-World Asset Collateral Advisory Council projects and funding

The Advisory Council is paid on a project basis to do specific work that improves all or specific parts of the Scope Framework.

* **1.3.1:** Each Quarter, if they deem it necessary, the Responsible Facilitators must solicit proposals and find one or more suitable Advisory Council Members to perform a project that will result in output that can be used to improve the Scope Framework. This work output will be presented to the CVC Subcommittee Meetings as the starting point for the CVC Scope Framework Position Documents. As many CVCs as possible should be supported this way, prioritized by the Responsible Facilitators.

* **1.3.2:** In case an ambiguous, uncertain or challenging situation arises related to the Scope Framework, the Responsible Facilitator may approach one or more Advisory Council Members to perform a reactive project that aims to specify the language of the Scope Framework to take into account the specific situation. The Responsible Facilitator can then directly propose the change to the Scope Framework in a weekly governance poll, quickly resolving the challenge.

* **1.3.3:** The Advisory Council may not produce work output that is directly compatible with the formatting of the Scope Framework. In this case the Responsible Facilitator must either transcribe it themselves, or hire an Ecosystem Actor to perform the transcribtion. This role does not require preapproval by Maker Governance.

* **1.3.4:** The Responsibel Facilitators may also produce advisory input on the content of the Scope Framework themselves, as long as it is focused on improving process and governance content. They are prohibited from providing unilateral input on expert subject matter content.

* **1.3.5:** The Responsible Facilitators have a budget available to pay for Advisory Council Projects per quarter. All spending must be limited to only what is deemed necessary and with a high probability of producing clearly measurable value, and this must be transparently be accounted for in a forum post at least a week before any transaction occurs.

* **1.3.5.1:**

¤¤¤

The Advisory Council project budget is up to 0 Dai per quarter. It is accessible as a keg that refills at a linear rate of 0 per 3 months, and has a maximum limit of 0.

## 2: The Implementation of the Real-World Asset Collateral Scope Framework through Software

The Responsible Facilitators must in collaboration with the CVC Subcommittees, periodically review possibilities of integrating DAO toolkit innovation into the processes and content of the Scope Framework.

## 3: Real-World Asset Arranger management

#### 3.1: Arranger definition

Arrangers are Ecosystem Actors that specialize in sourcing, structuring and attesting to Real-World Asset collateral types used by the Maker Protocol. They must never be able to operate or influence the structures and that they arrange, after the structures have already been built and activated, and may earn a fixed carry fee based on attestation activities. Arrangers cannot be Asset managers and are not allowed to actively manage or operate Real-World Asset allocations on behalf of Maker. Arrangers are approved directly by MKR voters, and all RWA collateral exposure must be structured by an approved Arranger.

#### 3.2: Active Arranger management

This section handles the logic of adding and removing Arrangers.

* **3.2.1:** Arrangers are onboarded or offboarded based on a governance poll by MKR voters, that is initiated by the Responsible Facilitators if they deem it necessary. The active state of current approved Arrangers is maintained in **3.2.1.2A**.

* **3.2.2.1:** In case of significant legal, regulatory or popular fear, uncertainty and doubt connected to an approved Arranger, the Responsible Facilitators must propose a governance poll to designate the Arranger as deactivated. A deactivated Arranger cannot onboard new structures, and their existing structures must be examined to determine whether it is feasible and affordable to shift their exposure to a different structure. Once the fear, uncertainty and doubt conditions have passed, the Responsible Facilitators must again propose a Governance Poll to reactivate the Arranger.

* **3.2.1.2A:**

### 3.3 Arranger standard fees

Arrangers may charge at most 15 basis points per year in fees on top of other fees charged by the structure and the Asset Manager. The fee is applied to the total value deployed in the structure. For stablecoin Attestation services, Arrangers may charge up to 5 basis points. The fee is applied is applied to the total amount of stablecoins that Maker has exposure to, that the arranger is providing attestation services for.

#### 3.4 Arranger concentration risk management

The Maker Protocol may not have more than 60% exposure of its Real-World Asset collateral to the structures of a single Arranger. In cases where for practical reasons there are not enough Arrangers able to allow Maker Governance to fully deploy its collateral in order to optimize the yield earned, the concentration requirement can be temporarily exceeded. This number must be continuously reduced, and the Responsible Facilitators must take action to search and propose onboarding of additional Arrangers when it is economically feasible to do so.

#### 3.5 Arranger attestations and stress tests

Arrangers must publish quarterly attestations for each structure they have arranged, and must alongside the attestations publish stress test analysis that shows how the structures would perform based on historical financial crisis scenarios and other example scenarios. The Responsible Facilitator must periodically fund independent Ecosystem Actors to review and verify the quality and the results of the stress tests. Should an independent review produce an unfavorable result, the Responsible Facilitator must propose governance poll for warning, temporarily inactivating, or permanently offboarding the Arranger and/or the Asset Managers connected to the discovered issue.

## 4: Asset Managers

#### 4.1: Asset Manager Definition

Asset Managers are Ecosystem Actors that actively manage and deploy capital allocated by the Maker Protocol into a trust structured by an Arranger. Asset Managers are chosen by Arrangers, who must present the Asset Managers alongside the other details of new RWA deployment opportunities that they propose to Maker Governance.

#### 4.2: Asset Manager current information

Asset Managers are not directly onboarded by Maker Governance, but are instead indirectly onboarded if they participate as Asset Managers in an arranged structure proposed by an approved Arranger and approved by Maker Governance. High quality, detailed, current and transparent information must be made available about all Asset Managers directly in the Real-World Collateral Scope Framework.

* **4.2.1:** The list of active Asset Managers is maintained in **4.2.1.2A**.

* **4.2.1.1:** In case of significant legal, regulatory or popular fear, uncertainty and doubt connected to an Asset Manager, the Responsible Facilitators must propose a governance poll to designate the Asset Manager as deactivated. A deactivated Asset Manager cannot be involved in new structures, and their involvement in existing structures must be examined to determine whether it is feasible and affordable to replace them. Once the fear, uncertainty and doubt conditions have passed, the Responsible Facilitators must again propose a Governance Poll to reactivate the Asset Manager.

* **4.2.1.2A:**

#### 4.3: Arranger and Asset Manager negotiations

Arrangers must negotiate RWA deployment opportunities with Asset Managers, and when the terms of a deal is fully negotiated, bring the deal to Maker Governance to consider. Arrangers must not have any conflict of interest with Asset Managers, and must always strive to deliver the best possible terms, with an emphasis on maximizing the yield earned by the Maker Protocol after all fees and other costs, while ensuring legal structure and financial risk is mininal.

## 5: Implementation of Direct Stablecoin Exposure

#### 5.1: The categories of Stablecoins approved for Direct Stablecoin Exposure

Direct Stablecoin Exposure is performed directly by the Maker Protocol in the long run, and as such is only performed on a very limited amount of Stablecoins that meets the highest criteria and meet critical strategic needs for maintaining the Dai peg and stability.

* **5.1.1:** *Cash Stablecoins* are stablecoins that Dai aims to directly peg to 1:1. They must always be available in large quantities in Maker PSMs with no fees.

* **5.1.2:** *Primary Yield Stablecoins* are stablecoins or other type of exposure that provides a yield, and can be rapidly converted into Cash Stablecoins through an automated smart contract, within a period of maximum 12 hours.

* **5.1.3:** *Secondary Yield Stablecoins* are stablecoins of the highest legal and financial quality that do not posses the necessary adoption and liquidity characteristics to be considered Cash Stablecoins, but that pay a yield when held directly in a PSM and a have a future potential to grow to the level of Cash Stablecoins. The Maker Protocol maintains a subsidized exposure to them for the sake of ensuring that alternative options exists in case any risks materialize related to the Cash Stablecoins.

#### 5.2: Target Direct Stablecoin Exposure and approved stablecoins

This section describes the implementation of the ALM model as it applies to Direct Stablecoin Exposure, and specifies specific stablecoins approved by Maker Governance, including their target exposure.

* **5.2.1:** *Cash Stablecoin Exposure*. Maker must maintain an exposure of 10% of the total ALM-Applied Portfolio to Cash Stablecoins. The breakdown of approved stablecoins and their individual parameters is described in the soft element **5.2.1.1**. The Responsible Facilitators can propose a governance poll to change the approved stablecoins and their targets if they deem it necessary.

* **5.2.1.1:**

¤¤¤

List of active Cash Stablecoins and their parameters:

USDC PSM - 100% of remaining exposure

GUNI-DAI/USDC 0.01% - fixed 100 million exposure (As GUNI-DAI/USDC 0.01% contains 50% Dai this is implemented as 200 million Debt Ceiling, but for the ALM model counts only as 100 million exposure), Stability Fee of 0.06%

¤¤¤

* **5.2.2:** *Primary Yield Stablecoin Exposure*. Maker must allocate all excess Cash Stablecoins to Primary Yield Stablecoinn assets through an automated mechanism. The breakdown of approved stablecoins and their individual parameters is described in the soft element **5.2.2.1**. The Responsible Facilitators can propose a governance poll to change the approved stablecoins and their parameters if they deem it necessary.

* **5.2.2.1**

¤¤¤

List of active Primary Yield Stablecoins and their parameters:

Coinbase Custody rewards - 100% of excess Cash Stablecoin exposure

¤¤¤

* **5.2.2.2:** A smart contract must move any excess Cash Stablecoin exposure into the Primary Yield Stablecoins, and must move any available Primary Yield Stablecoin assets into Cash Stablecoins if the protocol is below its target Cash Stablecoin exposure.

* **5.2.3:** *Secondary Yield Stablecoin Exposure*. Maker may maintain a limited allocation to Secondary Yield Stablecoin chosen by Maker Governance for their long term strategic value, if they meet specific requirements. The breakdown of approved stablecoins and their individual parameters is described in **5.2.3.3A**. The Responsible Facilitators can propose a governance poll to change the approved stablecoins and their parameters if they deem it necessary.

* **5.2.3.1:** Secondary Yield Stablecoins cannot exceed a 500 million Debt Ceiling.

* **5.2.3.2:** To mitigate reverse concentration risk Maker may at most make up 50% of the total supply of a Secondary Yield Stablecoin. The Responsible Facilitators must periodically update the effective Debt Ceiling parameter in **5.2.3.3A** based on this principle and following the update, bundle modifications to the live parameters in the Maker Protocol to be in line with **5.2.3.3A** in the weekly executive votes.

* **5.2.3.3:** In case of significant legal, regulatory or popular fear, uncertainty and doubt, the Responsible Facilitators must propose a governance poll to designate the Secondary Yield Stablecoin as deactivated. A deactivated Secondary Yield Stablecoin has its Debt Ceiling set to 0. Once the fear, uncertainty and doubt conditions have passed, the Responsible Facilitators must again propose a Governance Poll to reactivate the Secondary Yield Stablecoin.

* **5.2.3.4:** Up to 10% of the total ALM-applied Portfolio can be allocated to Secondary Yield Stablecoins, if all other conditions are met. The relative allocations between the Secondary Yield Stablecoins is weighted between them based on their yield.

* **5.2.3.4.0** *Example:*

* **5.2.3.4.0.1:** *If there are two Secondary Yield Stablecoins, A with yield of 1% and B with yield of 2%, then up to 33% of the maximum total allocation goes to A, and 66% of the maximum total allocation goes to B, before other constraints are accounted for.*

* **5.2.3.5A:**

¤¤¤

The list of approved Secondary Yield Stablecoin and their parameters:

USDP - 450 million Debt Ceiling; yield weight: 1.95%

GUSD - 280 million Debt Ceiling; yield weight: 1.5%; Temporary 0 Debt Ceiling

## 6: Implementation of Protector Real-World Asset Exposure

#### 6.1: Protector Real-World Asset Exposure Definition

Protector RWA Exposure is low risk RWA exposure optimized for yield by a Protector Advisor Ecosystem Actor. It plays the role that Protector SubDAOs will eventually do in the Endgame.

#### 6.2: Protector Advisor Management and Allocation
Protector Advisors are Ecosystem Actors approved by Maker Governance that each are delegated a portion of Dai Collateral Portfolio and are tasked with advicing Maker Governance on the optimal way to deploy their delegated allocation. The total allocation of Protector Real-World Asset Exposure is evenly split between all active Protector Advisors during the Pregame.

* **6.2.1:** The Responsible Facilitators can propose to add or remove Protector Advisors if they deem it necessary, by submitting a Governance Poll. Protector Advisors and their relative allocations of the Protector Real-World Asset Exposure are listed in **6.2.1.1A**.

   * **6.2.1.1A:**
¤¤¤
List of Protector Advisors and their parameters:
Spring (eth address) - 50%
Viridian (eth address) - 50%
¤¤¤

* **6.2.2:** Protector Advisor teams must monitor the allocation available to them and provide advise about favorable opportunities for allocating Real World Asset Collateral, and the Responsible Facilitators must review these opportunities and may choose to allocate funding for the technical implementation and bring them to a vote in the weekly governance cycle for collateral onboarding.

#### 6.3: The duration breakdown of Protector Advisor Exposure

Protector Advisor Real-World Asset Exposure must follow the following constraints:

* **6.3.1:** The Protector Advisor can propose up to (12.5% * Split) - (1-3 year Protocol exposure * Split) of exposure to Yield Collateral with at most a duration of 1-3 years, with an average of 2 years.

* **6.3.2:** The Protector Advisor can propose up to (50% * Split) - ( *6.3.1* exposure) - (6 months - 1 year Protocol Exposure * Split) of exposure to Yield Collateral with at most a duration of 6 months to 1 year, with an average of 9 months.

* **6.3.3:** The Protector Advisor can propose up to (80% * Split) - ( *6.3.1* exposure) - ( *6.3.2* exposure) - (1 month Protocol Exposure * Split) of exposure to Yield Collateral with at most a duration of 1 month.

#### 6.4: Approved types of Protector Advisor Real-World Assets

Protector Advisors can only asses and advice on Arranger structures that implement Maker Protocol exposure to specific assets defined in this section.

* **6.4.1:** Money Market Funds. These must be investment grade and must be possible to withdraw from within one week.

* **6.4.2:** US Government Treasury ETFs.

#### 6.5: Protector Advisor reports and stress tests

Protector Advisors must publish quarterly reports for their total Protector Advisor allocation, and must alongside the report publish stress test analysis that shows how their total Protector Advisor allocation would perform based on historical financial crisis scenarios and other best practice example scenarios. The Responsible Facilitator must periodically fund independent Ecosystem Actors to review and verify the quality and the results of the reports and stress tests. Should an independent review produce an unfavorable result, the Responsible Facilitator must propose a governance poll for warning, temporarily inactivating, or permanently offboarding the Protector Advisor and/or the Arrangers and/or Asset Managers connected to the discovered issue.

## 7: Technical implementation of Real World Asset Collateral Vaults

(Contains budget for collateral onboarding work).

## 8: Implementation of Clean Money

#### 8.1: Clean Money Real-World Asset exposure restrictions

As defined by the Maker Constitution, Maker may not have exposure to Real-World Assets that directly finance coal use for energy or electricity production. This does not apply to metallurgical coal or other usecases of coal where a lower-carbon

## 9: Legacy Real-World Asset Vaults

#### 9.1: Legacy Real-World Asset Vault definition

Legacy Real-World Asset Vaults are RWA vaults that were onboarded prior to the Endgame Constitution, and that are not adopted into the RWA Scope Framework by being compatible with the specifications in it. They are not counting in the main rules and processes, except for their influence on the ALM model due to their duration risk. They must be offboarded as quickly as is reasonable to do, considering all relevant economic and reputational factors, and this article must be updated to contain the except conditions and practical steps to execute the offboardings.

## MIP105c3: Responsible Facilitators

The Responsible Facilitators of the Real-World Asset Collateral Scope are responsible for adhering to the contents of the Scope Framework elements.

The Responsible Facilitators also have the governance privilege to interpret, trigger or use any of the processes described in the Scope Framework elements.

During the Pregame, the Responsible Facilitators are defined as the Core Unit facilitators of the Core Units that are listed as Responsible Facilitator Core Units.

The Responsible Facilitator Core Units for the Real-World Asset Collateral Scope are defined in MIP105c2.

## MIP105c4: Active Responsible Facilitator Core Unit list
