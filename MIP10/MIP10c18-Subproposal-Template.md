    - Is it a flat amount for all Feeds?
    - Do Dark Feeds and Light Feeds get paid different amounts?
    - Is the amount based on seniority?
    - Should the amount be raised to increase security?
    - Should the amount be lowered to reduce costs?
    - Is the Feed Stipend higher for Feeds exhibiting higher than average uptime and lower for Feeds exhibiting lower than average uptime?
    - Is the Feed Stipend proportional to the Dai supply?
    - Is the Feed Stipend proportional to the value of locked collateral?
    - Is the Feed Stipend inversely proportional to the number of Feeds?
    - Is the Feed Stipend proportional to the amount of stability fees?
