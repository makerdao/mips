## Disclaimer
MIP10 is meant to handle all of the Oracle relacated actions. Unfortunately MIP10 has inconsistencies and doesn’t conform to the monthly governance cadence that the Maker Improvement Proposal framework is built around. This has generated a backlog of Oracle proposals. While MIP10 is refactored to conform to the regular MIP process, Oracle proposals such as this one will utilize the more liberal weekly governance cycle. While strictly speaking this makes them not subproposals, they are included in the subproposal archive and denoted with a `*` suffix as point of provenance to serve as a paper trail.

### Introduction

* Motivation for running a Light Feed

As deeply passionate members of the Ethereum community we recognize the importance of trustless oracles in the functioning of a healthy DeFi landscape, and with more than two years of experience working on on-chain liquidity provision we want to take the next step and contribute to the further diversification of the trustless Oracles. We are really looking forward to the growth of both the DeFi space and MakerDAO.

### Community

* What has your organization contributed to the crypto community?

The team’s main focus and contribution over the last 3 years has been building Kyber Network protocol, an on-chain liquidity protocol that aggregates liquidity from a wide range of reserves and enables token exchange in any decentralized application. It also contributed through grants to Ethereum teams at very early stages (ie. Instadapp) and is an active member of the Ethereum community
* Successful products, services, tools, libraries, thought-leadership

Apart from Kyber Network, the various founders have been involved in:
    - Oyente - an analysis tool for smart contracts
    - PeaceRelay - a protocol to trustlessly connect EVM-compatible blockchains.
    - Smartpool - a decentralized PoW mining pool using smart contracts
    - Elastico - a sharding protocol for public blockchains.
* How will the Maker Community benefit from your inclusion as a Light Feed?

The Kyber team have gained valuable experience building one of the largest liquidity providers to the DeFi space over the last three years, and their addition as a stakeholder to the trustless Oracles further contributes to the strengthening of the expertise and know-how within the MakerDAO ecosystem.
