## Motivation

The Maker Protocol requires a decentralized workforce in order to onboard new collateral assets. This MIP  describes Domain Teams that are needed in the collateral onboarding process and highlights their special authority in the governance system to oversee critical processes and mitigate risk.

## Specification / Proposal Details

### MIP7c1: Domain Team Descriptions


- **Risk Teams** are responsible for creating the risk construct for a collateral onboarding proposal. As a part of the collateral on-boarding process, they also need to get a general model ratified on which they can base their risk construct.
- **Smart Contracts Teams** are responsible for developing and deploying the collateral adapter for new collateral onboarding, and creating the technical work product for collateral onboarding proposals.
- **Oracle Teams** are responsible for designing oracle feed mechanisms for new collateral types, compelling the oracles to upgrade their nodes with new price feeds for new collateral types via MIP10, and creating the oracle work product for collateral onboarding.
- **Legal Teams** are in some cases necessary for collateral onboarding, when dealing with assets that have legal claims attached to them. They create the legal work product for collateral onboarding.
