## Sentence Summary

MIP71 exempts the proposed HVBank collateral onboarding and subsequent amendments to the MBPT (as outlined in the [MIP6](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/mip6-huntingdon-valley-bank-loan-syndication-collateral-onboarding-application/14219)) from any MIP65-like collateral onboarding blocks.

## Paragraph Summary

MIP71 will exempt the HVBank collateral onboarding application from any limitations placed on Core Units by MIP65 or similar MIPs which impose such restrictions. If passed, the HVBank application will be permitted to continue through the existing collateral onboarding process undeterred.

## Component Summary

N/A

## Motivation

RWAC (on behalf of HVBank) seeks to provide a professional and stable onboarding experience to its clients. This MIP will achieve that by exempting the HVBank onboarding process from the instability of collateral/work blocks. This MIP is being proposed in tandem with [MIP70: Huntingdon Valley Bank Self-Contained Onboarding Strategy & Execution](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/mipxx-huntingdon-valley-bank-self-contained-onboarding-strategy-execution/14468) in the hope that both MIPs pass and HVBank can progress in the onboarding process without concern and maximum flexibility.

## Specification / Proposal Details

By passing this MIP, MKR holders will be exempting the HVBank collateral onboarding process from any MIP65-induced Core Unit work blockages.
