## Sentence Summary

The Arbitration Scope Framework provides the core principles, rules, and regulations regarding Arbitration in the Endgame.

## Paragraph Summary

MIP113 establishes the Arbitration Scope Framework, which covers principles and processes related to high-level decision-making, constitutional interpretation, and regulation of constitutional conservers and core governance processes. The Arbitration Scope plays a critical role in governance security, and its processes and rules must be defined to ensure they are followed with care and precision. The Arbitration Scope constrains and supersedes all other Scope Frameworks.

## Specification

### MIP113c1: Preamble

The Arbitration Scope covers principles and processes related to high-level decision-making, constitutional interpretation, and regulation of constitutional conservers and core governance processes. The Arbitration Scope plays a critical role in governance security, and its processes and rules must be defined to ensure they are followed with care and precision. The Arbitration Scope constrains and supersedes all other Scope Frameworks.

### MIP113c2: Scope Framework Articles

#### 1: Constitutional Interpretation

##### 1.1: Constitutional Interpretation definition
Constitutional Interpretation is used to disambiguate elements in the constitution with expanded definitions, in connection with specific decisions or disputes relying on language from the Maker Constitution. To make the Maker Constitution as solid and immutable as possible, all constitutional interpretation is recorded to set a precedent about the spirit of the constitution and how future interpretations should be made.

##### 1.2: Constitutional Interpretation Principles
* **1.2.1:** Constitutional Interpretation should only be employed when the Maker Constitution itself is unclear or contains faults or omissions that can be mitigated by extrapolating the spirit of the Constitution.  

* **1.2.2:** The resolution of constitutional ambiguity or disputes must be fully congruent with the spirit of the Constitution and prior precedent.  

* **1.2.3:** The resolution of constitutional ambiguity or disputes must clearly set new precedent that prevents a similar ambiguous situation from occurring in the future.  

* **1.2.4:** If the existence or proposed resolution of an ambiguity becomes contentious, one or more MKR votes may be initiated by the Arbitration Facilitators to resolve the contention.  

##### 1.3 Constitutional Intepretation Process
* **1.3.1:** Constitutional Interpretation precedent may be made directly by the Arbitration Facilitators without any MKR vote.
	* **1.3.1.1:** Constitutional Interpretation precedent made directly by the Arbitration Facilitators must be recorded as a subelement to the Active Element *1.3.3A*.
	* **1.3.1.2:** Entries to Active Element *1.3.3A* through *1.3.1* must denote the source of the precedent as 'Arbitration Direct'.
	
* **1.3.2:** Constitutional Interpretation precedent may be made according to the outcome of an MKR vote initiated by the Arbitration Facilitators.
	* **1.3.2.1:** Any MKR vote on constitutional precedent must contain a proposed change to the wording of the constitution, which is limited to resolving the ambiguity.
	* **1.3.2.2:** Any MKR vote on constitutional precedent must contain a proposed entry to Active Element 1.3.3A, detailing the precedent used to resolve the ambiguity.
	* **1.3.2.3:** If the outcome of the vote meets the requirements of Article 11 of the Constitution then the Constitution is amended using the proposed change described in *1.3.2.1*.
	* **1.3.2.4:** If the outcome of the vote is positive, the Constitutional Interpretation precedent must be recorded as a subelement in the Active Element *1.3.3A* using the proposed change described in *1.3.2.2*.
	* **1.3.2.5:** Entries to Active Element *1.3.3A* through *1.3.2* must denote the source of the precedent as 'Arbitration Vote'.
	* **1.3.2.6:** With the exception of the other elements under *1.3.2*, any MKR vote intended to resolve ambiguity in the Constitution may be structured freely by the Arbitration Facilitators.

* **1.3.3A**

##### 2.1: Scope Framework Appeals Eligibility
A Scope Framework appeal is a process that triggers a review of a Scope Framework. This process is valid in either of the following scenarios:
* **2.1.1:** A Scope Framework appeal is valid if a scope framework does not adhere to every Constitutional Boundary.

* **2.1.2:** A Scope Framework appeal is valid if a scope framework contains biased or otherwise conflicted elements.

* **2.2.2:** Scope Framework appeal proposals must be submitted publicly.  

* **2.2.3:** Scope Framework appeal proposals must be reviewed by the Arbitration Facilitators.  

* **2.2.4:** Scope Framework appeal proposals must be declared valid or invalid by the Arbitration Facilitators. Declaration and reasoning must be publicly communicated.  

* **2.2.5:** Scope Framework appeal proposals must be declared accepted or rejected by the Arbitration Facilitators. Declaration and reasoning must be publicly communicated.  

##### 2.3 Modifications to Scope Frameworks on Constitutional Grounds
Modifications to Scope Frameworks on Constitutional Grounds must adhere to the following rules:
* **2.3.1:** The Arbitration Facilitators may directly edit a Scope Framework to align its content with the constitutional boundaries and any other constitutional requirements. Changes and reasoning must be publicly communicated.  

* **2.3.2:** The Arbitration Facilitators may initiate an MKR vote to ratify an edit to a Scope Framework that resolves the issue(s) that triggered a valid, accepted Scope Framework appeal.

##### 3.4: Consitutional Conserver Fallbacks
If a Constitutional Conserver breaks the adherence requirements, but the Arbitration Facilitators fail to derecognize them, the following fallback process may be used.
* **3.4.1:** Any entity may send 10 MKR to the Pause Proxy contract, and publicly communicate their intention to derecognize an identified Constitutional Conserver.  

* **3.4.2:** The Arbitration Facilitators must initiate an MKR vote to derecognize the identified Constitutional Conserver if the requirements of *3.4.1* are met.
	* **3.4.2.1:** The vote format is plurality and must include the following three options: 'Yes', 'No, and burn stake' and 'No, and return stake').
	* **3.4.2.2:** If the 'Yes' option wins by majority, the Constitutional Conserver is derecognized, and the 10 MKR is returned to the source address.
	* **3.4.2.3:** If the 'No, and return stake' option wins by plurality, the 10 MKR is returned to the source address.
	* **3.4.2.4:** Otherwise, the 10 MKR is not returned to the source address.

### MIP113c3: Responsible Facilitators

The Responsible Facilitators of each Scope Framework are responsible for adhering to the contents of the relevant Scope Framework elements.

The Responsible Facilitators also have the governance privilege to interpret, trigger or use any of the processes described in the Scope Framework elements.

During the Pregame, the Responsible Facilitators are defined as the Core Unit Facilitators of the Core Units that are listed as Responsible Facilitator Core Units.

The Responsible Facilitator Core Units for each Scope are defined in MIP113c2.6.1.2.1A.

### MIP113c4: Active Responsible Facilitator Core Unit List Modification Subproposal Process

This component is a subproposal process component that, if approved by Maker Governance, modifies the state of MIP113c2.6.1.2.1A to update the list of Responsible Facilitators.

Subproposals must use the [Active Responsible Facilitator Core Unit List Modification Template](https://github.com/makerdao/mips/blob/master/MIP113/MIP113c4-Subproposal-Template.md).

This component can be used to add, amend, or remove Responsible Facilitator Core Units from any of the approved Scope Frameworks.

MIP113c4 subproposals have the following parameters:

- **Default Feedback Period**: 1 month
- **Frozen Period**: 1 week
- **Governance Cycle**: Monthly
- **Other Requirements**: None.

### MIP113c5: Scope Framework Articles modification Sub Proposal process

During the Pregame the Scope Framework articles can be modified through the Monthly Governance Cycle using a MIP102c2 subproposal.
