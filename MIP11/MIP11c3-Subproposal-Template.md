    	1. A framework for quantitative risk methodology, fundamental analysis or due diligence.  
    	2. A scoring framework for collateral assets that enables a standardized approach for converting qualitative analysis into numerical outputs. This is achieved through a ratings-based methodology.
    	3. A quantitative model that describes the process for computing risk parameters such as the Stability Fee, Liquidation Ratio, DSR, etc.
